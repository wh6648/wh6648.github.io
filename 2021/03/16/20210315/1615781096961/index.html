<p>According to the general rule, the MVP, the most important personal honor trophy in NBA, should have something to do with its ownership after half a season’s regular match.</p>
<p>But in the past two years, with the collapse of the warrior super warship, the league’s superstars have experienced a new wave of distribution. Specific to this season, the strength of several teams competing for the championship has become close. In order to rank among the teams, it is hard to predict whether they will win or lose. At the same time, the player awards, especially the selection of MVP, are naturally in suspense.</p>
<p>If we only take the first half of the season as the sample, then the core of the 76ers, Joel nbid, is undoubtedly the most popular candidate for the podorov cup.</p>
<p>In the future of the season, the 76ers have always been at the top of the Eastern League. As the leader of the team, the performance of “Dadi” is even more impressive. He has played 30 games, averaging 30.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.2 steals, with a shooting percentage of 52.1%, a three-point shooting percentage of 41.6% and a free throw percentage of 85.6%. His output is one of the top in history, and his super “180” efficiency is high, It is even more rare in history.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after the all star game, against the wizards, the emperor injured his left knee bone. Although he escaped the bad luck of serious injury, he would be absent for at least two to three weeks, so the probability of MVP winning the first place was cut by half.</p>
<p>The injury of the great emperor has given the League another superstar center an opportunity. The core of nuggets, Nikolay Jokic, has given up the “bad habit” of rowing in the regular season this season, showing the league’s strongest output ability. So far this season, he has averaged 27.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, 8.6 assists and 1.6 steals per game, all of which are career highs. In addition, he got 34 double doubles and 9 triple doubles, showing his all-round characteristics incisively and vividly. The only problem is that the Nuggets are only ranked sixth in the west, which has become a short board in Mr. Yue’s campaign.</p>
<p>But no matter who can win the prize, for the center of the league, it is of special significance. Today, purebred center has a hard time in the NBA, but the appearance of the great emperor’s peace appointment teacher on the list sends a strong signal of confrontation with the current “little ball” trend. Looking back on history, the last time an orthodox and heavyweight Center won the MVP, it has to be traced back to the distant 1999-2000 season, when O’Neal was still the “big shark” ruling the league.</p>
<p>However, the emperor, about the teacher’s coronation, also faces several outside star’s challenge, bears the brunt, is in January joined the nets James - harden. In fact, before coming to Brooklyn, bearded had little hope for MVP. However, in the new owner more than two months time, beard suddenly found a new inspiration. In the past 12 games, harden led the team to 11-1, ranking first in the league in the same period. During this period, harden averaged 27 points, 9.7 rebounds, 10.7 assists and 49.3% shooting percentage. In Durant’s absence due to injury, the team’s lineup is still not neat, harden has brought the nets to the second place in the East, also let himself successfully return to the MVP competition sequence.</p>
<p>LeBron - James, although, due to the recent injury of brother Nongmei, the Lakers play very hard, but as a 36 year old veteran, Zhan Huang can still get 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game. If he wins the prize, he will surpass Karl Malone (35 years old) in 1998-99 and become the oldest MVP, creating a historical story. In the context of the alliance’s shrinking influence due to the epidemic, this inspiring story may be exactly what Xiao Hua needs</p>
<p>Of course, don’t forget Dong Qiqi. After adjusting and losing weight at the beginning of the season, Dong Qiqi and his lone ranger are getting better and better after entering the new year. So far, Dong Qiqi has averaged 28.2 points, 9.2 assists and 8.4 rebounds per game, and all three data have returned to the level of last season. The lone ranger has quietly returned to the top eight in the west after 7-3 in the last 10 games.</p>
<p>And don’t forget the letters brother and Lillard. This season, the letter brother scores, rebounds have declined, but assists skills have been developed; Lee guidance continues to maintain 29.7 points, 8 assists, 4.4 rebounds of high standard combat power, on the record, on the data, in previous years, the two people are hopeful to enter the top three of the list, but this season, MVP competition is really fierce, even if better than Lee guidance, even in the first two seasons MVP letter brother, but also can only be pushed to the back row.
