On June 10, the Suns beat the Nuggets 123-98 at home. Devon Booker made 6-for-14 shots, 3-for-7 shots and 3-for-3 free throws in 33 minutes, contributing 18 points, 10 rebounds, 2 assists and 1 steals. The positive and negative value on the field was + 16.

Before that, as the player who did not have the most points in the playoff experience, Booker finally ushered in his first playoff trip this season with the help of Chris Paul. After the baptism of the first round of the playoffs, today's Booker has adapted to the more fierce competition of the playoffs stage, and has the style of a general. Especially during Paul's shoulder injury, Booker took on more responsibilities. Paul also appreciates Booker's performance. Frankly speaking, Booker is very special. He is not surprised by his performance. I'm glad everyone can see his performance in the national live broadcast.

The defense of the visiting team has really troubled Booker. In the first quarter, Booker shot five times and hit two goals, two of which were three points. In the second quarter, with 9 minutes and 4 seconds left, Booker made his debut again, but the offensive end was still very difficult, not only failed, but also was forced to make mistakes. In the second half of the festival, Booker began to enhance his aggressiveness, not only playing 2 + 1 on rivers, but also performing a fast break dunk after stealing.

The game entered the second half, Nuggets still did not relax the defense of Booker, 6:30 seconds, Booker and Paul line, after the ball into the net, the Suns will expand the lead to as much as 20 points. After a few rounds, Booker easily scored three points in the outside. Booker didn't play in the fourth quarter because of a big lead.
