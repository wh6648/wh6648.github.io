June 10 news, reports from the U.S. media said that the Nets coach Steve Nash confirmed in an interview today that guard James Harden will not play in the Eastern Conference semi-finals G3.

The nets are 2-0 ahead of the bucks. Because the situation is better, so the nets medical team is more cautious, they think "mustache" also need some recovery time.

"James (harden) will continue to miss G3," Nash said, "but we are very optimistic about his return at some point in time."

Harden was injured in G1 of last Sunday's series. The opening only 43 seconds, harden will return to the dressing room because of right leg discomfort, after the Nets Official declared harden will not return. During the match, harden left the arena for MRI.

The good news is that there was no structural damage to harden's right hamstring. Informed sources revealed that for long-term consideration, the nets will not let harden risk coming back.

Harden is suffering from a hamstring injury this season. During the regular season, he missed 21 games due to a hamstring injury and did not return until the end of the regular season. During the eastern semi-finals, harden was again trapped with a hamstring injury.

Since the playoffs this year, harden has averaged 23.2 points, 6.2 rebounds, 8.8 assists and 1.7 steals, with a three-point shooting rate of 47.5%.
