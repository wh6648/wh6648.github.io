On June 10, according to a report by famous NBA reporter Samas chalaniya, a well-informed source said that hawks forward de Andre hunt will undergo meniscus surgery on his right knee and will be absent for the rest of the season.

It's definitely bad news for the eagles. Because at present, hunt is a very important player in the Hawks' offensive and defensive system.

Yes, hunt is the eagles' top wing defender. But before G1 in the eastern semi-final, he had a slight swelling in his right knee. MRI showed a small tear in the lateral meniscus of Hunt's right knee.

According to the plan, hunt will fly to Los Angeles this weekend, and then undergo meniscus surgery next Tuesday local time.

Hunt averaged 15.0 points and 4.8 rebounds in the regular season. During the playoffs, Hunt had 10.8 points and 4.0 rebounds per game.

Hunt's reimbursement this season means that the eagles need to have more role players at both ends of the offensive and defensive!
