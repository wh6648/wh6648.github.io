Nikolay Jokic won the MVP this season without any doubt. As a Serb player, he won the highest honor in the NBA for this European basketball country. He is also the third European player to win the MVP after Dirk Nowitzki and Letterman. However, the European basketball genius was seriously underestimated at the beginning of his career, and only ranked 41st in the second round in the 2014 draft. How did he emerge?

His childhood was unfortunate. He was born on February 19, 1995 in the small town of songbor in Vojvodina (an autonomous province in northern Serbia). He has two older brothers named Nemanja and stringa. V province is the industrial base of Serbia, or the granary of Eastern Europe, which provides rich nutrition for fat people. But in March 1999, when he was only four years old, the Kosovo war, the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, broke out. He, his grandmother, parents and two brothers hid in a dark air raid shelter. The harsh siren came unexpectedly. Even at nine o'clock in the morning, his world was still dark. The war finally passed, and a family of six crowded into a small apartment.

When he was a child, Jokic didn't like basketball and received formal basketball education very late. He preferred horse racing and often accompanied the strong horses in the stable. He took part in horse racing and won the fourth place in the local race. Before the age of 14, basketball was only his hobby. He and his two brothers played basketball on the basketball court near his apartment. Because of the noise, he was protested by his neighbors from time to time. The two brothers played badly, like "Kendrick Perkins" (by joachi), while joachi played with ease.

Around 2011, Jokic moved with his family to Novi Sad, the second largest city in Serbia, to join Vojvodina srbijagas club, which is the beginning of his professional basketball. In 2012, mega leks of Belgrade signed the talented teenager. In the next three years (2012-2015), he participated in the Adriatic League (the most influential regional tournament in the Balkans of Eastern Europe, founded in 2001) and the professional league of Serbia. Joachi made great progress and won the regular season MVP in 2015.

Unfortunately, the door of NBA only opened a narrow gap for him. In the 2014 draft, due to his bulky body, the draft report ridiculed him: "he has a strong personality, teamwork spirit and good professional ethics, and can follow the instructions of the coach - these descriptions about the advantages of Jokic seem to be more like a student competing for the president of the student union." In the end, he was selected by the Nuggets in the 41st place in the second round. He stayed in Serbia and did not decide to join the NBA until the team was eliminated by the partisans in the semi-final of the Serbia League. On July 29, 2015, Jokic signed a contract with nuggets and moved to Denver with his family and girlfriend natalica maccic (who fell in love with songball in his early years), starting a legendary career. In fact, Jokic has a long history with the NBA. His brother Nemanja won a scholarship from the University of Detroit and lived in the house of fellow NBA star "human victory cigar" Milicic in Rochester hill. He watched Milicic degenerate and leave the NBA in his infatuation. Nemanja also returned home and talked with his brother about the destruction of the NBA.

Jojic didn't go well in the early days of the NBA. He was faced with competition from his Bosnian center mate nurkic from the Balkans. Jokic showed amazing talent and soon became the core of nuggets; Nuerjic, who was inferior, was finally traded by nuggets to pioneers on February 13, 2017. It is worth mentioning that Jordan and Nuo compete fiercely for the same position. Their motherland used to be an enemy country, but they maintain a deep friendship. Jokic said: "war is a matter between countries, not between people!" They have adjacent lockers and tease assistant coach ogin Stojakovic with a common language, serbo Croatian.

Jokic made his debut in the 2018 season. The combination of him and Murray came into people's view. The team passed all the way before the regular season and once squeezed into the top eight. Unfortunately, Millsap, the veteran introduced from the eagles, broke the running in of the team after his recovery from injury. The team's record finally fell to the ninth place in the western region, but the nickname of teacher Yue resounded throughout the league. This European center has a better vision and intelligence than sabonis, Divac and other European centers. He is a rare center with a big core of holding the ball. He has plenty of physical strength, can pass the good ball in high and low positions, and can dribble the ball through the half court. He has excellent attack skills, can back body can face frame, can hook, can jump shot, can lay up, attack range extends to the three-point line. He has high-quality cover, excellent ability of no ball and rebounding. He is a fat dancer on the court and can control the field with the ball, while Murray is a first-class attacker. He is good at running without the ball and attacking hard. The northwest Errenzhuan of Yue and mu can hardly defend with the help of Xingyunliushui. The attack of the textbook makes him win the reputation of "teacher Yue". However, Jokic moved slowly, and the pick and roll defects of 2018 season were targeted by the opponents.

In the 2019 season, Malone coach adopts the way of big delay or pinch attack to optimize the strategy of anti pick and roll. Millsap and other forwards are the helpers of Jokic's defense, which makes up for the defects of Jokic's defense to a certain extent. Jojic led the team to win the second place in the western region, won the first team, and finally lost in the Western semi-finals. In the 2020 season, he was the third in the western region and won the second round. In the playoffs, he eliminated the jazz and the Clippers one after another. In these two rounds, he was 1-3 behind and then reversed greatly. In the end, he was defeated by the champion Laker in the western region. In the past two years, Jokic has become a hot top 10 star. He has strong physical reserves in the playoffs and can carry hard battles. He often plays seven games in a series, and still wins the reputation of "about G7"; But in the regular season, he often uses the method of keeping fit. Sometimes, he will lose his temper because of drinking coke, and sometimes he will not play well. The data is not good-looking, which is not good for him to win the MVP honor.

In 2021 season, however, it's not the same. Streaky yukic took up the offensive flag of the team and entered the "full fat" mode. He scored 26.4 points + 10.8 boards + 8.3 assists in the regular season, which is an all-round scoring machine. The high-level data WS is 15.6, BPM is 11.7 and vorp is 8.6, ranking first in the league; Wins is 15.85 (third in the league, after curry and Gerber), RPM is 5.08 (sixth in the League).

In the off-season, because grant and pramley were "headhunted" by the pistons, Nuggets' strength was damaged for a time. Fortunately, the team traded alon Gordon from the magic team in time. Gordon has good breakthrough, scoring, slitting and defensive ability, which is an important supplement for yorkie and Murray. Kampazo, little rivers and green and other reinforcement is also very good. Porter, the third in charge, has evolved, and the level of air cutting, projection and ball holding singles has improved, with a star like appearance. Nuggets play a pleasant offensive, in the West has a strong competitiveness. Unfortunately, Murray because of left knee cruciate ligament tear, for the title prospects cast a shadow, the media generally underestimated the Nuggets' fighting power. But Jokic withstood the pressure and burned himself, leading the team to play third in the west when the wounded were full. With James, nbid and harden and other MVP competitors out of the competition because of injury, Jokic finally locked in the MVP.
