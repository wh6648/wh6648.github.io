June 10 news, from the NBA famous reporter Samas - chalaniya reported that informed sources revealed that the Lakers superstar LeBron James will wear No. 6 Jersey next season.

James has been wearing the No. 23 Jersey since he joined the Lakers off-season in 2018. After that, he had intended to give No. 23 to Anthony Davis. Next season, James will be changed from No.23 to No.6. What about the thick eyebrow? The source said that thick eyebrow is expected to continue to wear size 3.

James first wore number six in the US men's basketball team. After joining the heat in the summer of 2010, James also wore No. 6 because Miami retired from No. 23.

In the summer of 2019, the Lakers got a big eyebrow through a trade. James's original plan was to go back to No. 6 and give No. 23 to Nongmei, because Nongmei wore No. 23 all his life in the pelicans. But in the end, because of other commercial decisions, the change was unsuccessful.

During the No. 6 period, James averaged 26.9 points, 7.6 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 1.7 steals. James had 27.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.6 assists and 1.5 steals.

As a result, James is expected to become the first player in NBA history to have four retired jerseys, namely Cavaliers No. 23, heat No. 6, Laker No. 23 and Laker No. 6. In NBA history, Chamberlain and Peter malawich have the most retired jerseys, each with three retired jerseys.

This year's playoffs, James career for the first time out in the first round of the playoffs. In 2020, he led the Lakers to the 17th championship.
