On June 10, according to a report from sports illustrated, a well-informed source revealed that Celtic and kenba Walker both hope to go their separate ways in the off-season of this year.

According to the source, the green army tried to trade Walker in 2020, and since then there has been a gap between the two sides. After the end of this season's journey, the management of the green army has ushered in great changes. Denny Angie chooses to retire, and former coach Brad Stevens takes over the post of president of basketball operations.

It is pointed out that the green army will continue to build teams around Jason Tatum and Jay brown. It is reported that Walker is not in the long-term plan of the green army, and Walker himself hopes to start a new journey.

In the off-season of 2019, the green army and the Hornets reached a deal of first signing and then exchanging. Walker came to Boston with a big contract of $141 million in four years. At that time, Carey Owen chose to leave the green army and join the nets, so Walker was regarded as Owen's successor.

Walker has two years left on his current contract, with an annual salary of $36 million for the 21-22 season and a player option worth $37.65 million in the summer of 2022.

According to previous rumors, Walker's trading value is now negative. NBA reporter Michael scoto said: "the green army may have to reverse draft rights and future assets before they can trade Walker out."
