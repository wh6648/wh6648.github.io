On May 23, reports from the U.S. media said that LeBron James, the leading star of the Lakers, had been found to have violated the NBA health and safety agreement, but it would not affect his appearance in the first game of the first round of the playoffs next Monday.

James attended a commercial promotion before the additional game between the Lakers and warriors. Guests attending the promotion must show their vaccination certificate or recent nucleic acid test negative report. But even so, James broke the league rules.

"It's a violation of the health and safety agreement, and as we have done in other similar incidents in the league, the team has solved the problem," an NBA spokesman said In an interview on Saturday, a reporter asked James if he had been vaccinated. James didn't respond positively. He just said, "it's no big deal."

Prior to this, the Lakers point guard Dennis Schroeder has revealed that he is the only one in the team has not been vaccinated. But coach Frank Vogel said in a later interview that the Laker's vaccination rate did not meet the league's requirement of 85%.

Laker reporter bill Oram said he got the tip that James' violations will not affect his first round of the playoffs against the Suns on Sunday local time. The reason is that the promotion is outdoor, and the activity requires proof of vaccination or a recent negative nucleic acid test report. So, James' violations are not that serious.
