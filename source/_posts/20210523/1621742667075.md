On May 23, the Celtics lost to the nets in the eastern playoffs. Tatum, the Celtics star in charge, was in a low state, making only 6 of 20 shots and scoring 22 points and 5 assists.

As soon as Tatum came up, he hit the jump shot. Then he broke through the layup and took a 3-point step back to get 7 points in a row. He felt very hot. Then Tatum stopped and missed 3 points. When he came back, his hand didn't last. First, he made a mistake in passing, then he missed half of the basket, and scored 7 points in the first quarter.

In the second quarter of the game, he was blocked by harden as soon as he came up, but he immediately made a second attack to make the opponent foul, and made two free throws. Then Tatum hit from the middle distance and snatched harden. After that, Tatum cut into the layup to score, and then made a breakthrough to hit the ball. Then he continuously instigated the attack to help his teammates score. But at the last moment, Tatum made a pass error and encountered the opponent's broken ball to counterattack. It is worth mentioning that in this section of the game, Tatum suffered Clarkston hit the head, but he was more restrained.

In the third quarter of the game, Tatum sent out two fouls in a row, which made him unable to defend Durant. After that, Tatum also made mistakes in kicking, but he quickly adjusted his form and made a killing score. However, Tatum still didn't have much hand feeling in the outside line. He failed to score three points in a row and still relied on the free throw.
