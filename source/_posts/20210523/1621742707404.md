May 23 news, 20.6 seconds before the final, Paul George three-point basket does not enter, Luca dongqiqi grabs the backcourt backboard, triple double! Today, the lone ranger team captured the fast fleet away, making a good start for this year's playoffs. In this battle, Dong Qiqi played for 41 minutes, making 11 of 24 shots, including 5 of 11 three-point shots, handing over 31 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists, 1 steals and 2 blocks. The positive and negative value on the field reached + 19, the highest in the whole game.

Dong Qiqi played a superstar performance. It's just his seventh playoff game of his career, and it's his third triple double. This victory is very important for the lone Rangers because it's the second time they've taken a big lead in the series since winning in 2011. The last time was in 2014 with the Spurs G3, when Vince Carter hit the winner to help the lone Rangers lead 2-1.

Dong Qiqi became the ninth player in NBA history to score 30 + triple doubles at least twice in the playoffs. The remaining eight players were LeBron James (15 times), Oscar Robertson (8 times), Russell Westbrook (6 times), Charles Barkley (2 times), Jimmy Butler (2 times), Chamberlain (2 times), Stephen curry (2 times), and James Harden (2 times).

It is worth mentioning that, except for Dong Qiqi, no one of the lone Rangers has ever won three doubles in the playoffs. Dong Qiqi scored three doubles in the playoffs three times before the age of 23, the second most in history, after "magic" Johnson (11 times). Data will not lie. In the first seven playoffs of his career, Dong Qiqi scored 31 points, 9 rebounds and 9.8 assists.

"I don't really care about MVP," Dong said in an interview on the sidelines after the game. Obviously, nothing is more important than the championship. Also, I forgot how much fun it was to play in the playoffs... "
