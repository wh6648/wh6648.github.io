On May 23, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs began. In the East, the Brooklyn nets are at home for the first game of the series against Boston Celtics. After the game, the Nets beat the green shirts 104-93 and made a good start to the series.

In this game, harden scored 21 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists and 4 steals, the data is quite comprehensive, but his game state still needs debugging, has not reached the best.

In the first game of the playoffs, the net can finally stand on the court with a full posture.

However, it is one thing to have a well-organized team. The chemical reaction of the team and the state of the team members, especially the core members, are another thing.

James Harden, in particular, came back in the last two games of the regular season. After the regular season, harden had a full rest with the team for a week. It is undoubtedly very difficult for him to quickly find his best form.

Come to this game, harden appeared in his most familiar position, the attack of the net is also dominated by him. However, different from the previous orderly game, mustache didn't get the first two points by layup until he played four minutes in the first quarter. Next, he delivered three wonderful passes in more than a minute, assisting Joe Harris and Durant to attack the basket completely, including two KD smashes, which attracted high decibel cheers.

However, harden's attack and three passes did not lead to a string of points in the nets. Because the Nets' outside touch was extremely bad, the green shirt army could safely shrink the defense line and tighten the fence near the three second area to encircle the Nets' assault.

When the game came to the second quarter, the situation didn't change much. Harden continued to score by layup. After that, he used the "touch porcelain" stunt twice. As long as he had the chance, he would feed his teammates for the first time.

But frankly speaking, the whole first half, harden's organization is not qualified, the whole net attack is quite difficult, the score is always behind. This kind of play, with the outside world to the rebound net ultra-high expectations, obviously there is a gap.

However, the situation changed in the second half. With the three giants working together, the attack of the nets quickly improved to a higher level. During this period, harden is not the number one scorer of the nets, but his three-point retreat is timely enough, and his assists for his teammates are still accurate.

At the end of the third quarter, harden held the ball and signaled everyone to open it. Then, he turned to Jabari Parker. Despite Parker's tight defensive pursuit and two fierce body collisions during the period, mustache still got rid of it and used his best left side breakthrough to advance the ball.

At the end of the game, the advantage of the nets talent appeared. Under Durant and Owen's repeated attacks, the defense of the visiting team was gradually unable to hold up.
