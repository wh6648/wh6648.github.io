On May 23, the NBA playoffs started in full swing. The second Eastern basketball net played at home against the seventh Eastern Celtic. In the end, the net beat Celtic 104-93 and made a good start. Owen scored 29 points and 6 rebounds in 11 of 20 shots.

When Owen and harden are on the court at the same time, there must be one person to sacrifice the right to the ball. Most of the time, Owen is just an end point of attack, which greatly affects his attack performance. However, at the beginning of the game, Owen had a lot of offensive tricks, but his performance was not good. He missed three points and threw from the basket one after another after he helped the nets to open the record with a fast shot. Although he had a strong breakthrough, funier walked the bottom line to wipe the defense and forced the attack to lay up, but later he made a strong breakthrough to the inside line, which was overturned by Robert Williams from the big hat behind him, He missed two three-point shots in a row.

In the first half of the second quarter, harden was in charge of the ball, and Owen didn't have much chance to show. Until the middle of the second quarter, Owen broke through a sudden stop and hit 2 + 1 to help the team catch up with 3 points. When Celtic extended the difference to 8 points again, Owen made a low turn and shot. At this stage, Owen can only have some sporadic offensive performance. In the first half, Owen only made 4 of 10 shots, so his performance was just average.

At the beginning of the second half, Owen's situation was the same. He was rarely able to control the ball and had few chances to perform. Only when Durant scored in a row, Owen scored a three-point icing on the cake to help the nets play a wave of 13-4 climax. However, in the middle of the third quarter, the offensive focus of the nets shifted to Owen, who also played a wave of continuous attacks. He hit two consecutive hits in the middle shot, hit the board in time when he was in the trap, and finally scored three points by Harris. It was Owen's continued fire in the middle of the third quarter that helped the nets stabilize the lead.

However, it was in the middle of the last quarter that he really won the game. When he came back in the middle of the last quarter, the Celtics narrowed the difference to only 3 points. At this time, Owen began his continuous offensive performance. First he made a quick stop and hit the shot, then he took the ball and made a three-point dash. Then he made two free throws and hit green when he missed the bottom corner, Owen rushed in from the outside line, leaped high to complete the make-up shot, and soon received the ball under the basket to hit easily. He scored 11 points and led the team to play a 17-3 high tide, expanding the difference to 17 points.

It is this wave of climax completely laid the foundation for the nets to win. After encountering the bag clip under the basket, Owen passed the ball to the empty cutting harden in time to make a foul. Owen scored 13 points at the end of the whole quarter to help the nets resist Celtic's counterattack at the decisive moment and finally expand the lead to win easily.
