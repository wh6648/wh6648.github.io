On May 23rd, despite the fact that the playoffs were still stable, they could not suck up their teammates around Leonard. In this context, the lone Rangers dare to boldly clamp the small card in the second half, so as to limit the Clippers to play the leading star.

Even so, Leonard's data is still excellent, he played 41 minutes, 9-for-22 shots, delivered 26 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals, and there was no fault on the court. In fact, in the first half, Carra's performance was remarkable. He scored 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals in 5 of 10 shots, but the problem was that the lone Rangers team focused on Carra's defense in the second half, especially in the last quarter, even if he got the ball from the outside line, he would be trapped. What should I do? Small cards make opportunities for teammates, but teammates are suck.

It's definitely the best shot of today's game. Three minutes and 59 seconds before the end of the third quarter, Leonard snatched from the backcourt and made a one-stop fast break. Facing Maxi Kleiber in front of him, Leonard dunked with one hand and overturned Kleiber to the ground at the same time. This brutal dunk shows Leonard's personal ability. "It's definitely one of the best dunks in the playoffs this year," the commentator said

But the problem is, in the first half he got 17 points, in the second half he got only nine. 48.4 seconds before the end of the game, Leonard faced Luca dongqiqi and Kleiber's bag clip, he chose to force his hand under the basket to cause a foul. This season, Leonard's free throw percentage is as high as 89%, but he missed the first penalty. At that time, the clippers were seven points behind, so he missed the free throw and hurt the Clippers a lot. On the other hand, it can also be seen that Leonard's physical exertion is great. After all, he needs to face the bag often.

Before 2-1, Leonard had a jump shot near the free throw line, but the strength was too light to hit the front of the basket. Leonard had 26 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals.
