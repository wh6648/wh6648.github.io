On May 1, the NBA regular season continued. The Brooklyn nets lost 109-128 to the Portland Trail Blazers, ending a four game winning streak.

This battle, the core of the basketball net Carey Owen scored 28 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists in 12 of 26 shots, which is obviously not qualified for the single core LED Owen.

Owen recently participated in Ramadan activities and asked not to eat after sunrise and before sunset. It's hard to say whether this kind of diet adjustment will affect the players' state, but from the past two games, Owen's offensive state is not stable, but in the defensive end, Owen showed his desire for victory with his actual actions.

Sure enough, Owen didn't rush to attack, but made a contribution on the defensive side. The first attack round of the Blazers was cut by Owen. The offensive end is also unrelenting, three decisive shot steady hit.

This season's Owen, in the absence of harden, will deliberately reduce the singles after the beginning, a large part of his energy will be focused on driving his teammates, which is also his constant mature performance. But Owen is not harden after all, from the point of view of the ability of scoring and assists to switch at will, Owen will still show hesitation in the instant choice. This also led to his efficiency in the first quarter is not high, 10 shots only 3 hits.

From the second quarter, Owen showed a super star's strong ability to adjust on the field. He handed over the ball right and made more use of no ball to help his teammates create opportunities. For the choice of the shot is also more careful, with the no ball move again and again to find the opportunity of open shot. When a teammate is vacant, he can always deliver the ball to the team as soon as possible. It was his key assists in front of midfield that green hit with three points and chased the difference to two.

Irving, who is easy to fight again, finally finds his hand. First, he stops in a short distance, which is picturesque, and then he strikes back quickly. At the critical moment, he comes forward to kill and break the momentum of the pioneers. In the middle of the third quarter, ouwenli scored 7 points in a row and reduced the difference to 1 point with his own efforts. But helpless rebound in the defensive end did not limit the Blazers' score, Owen left the end of the third quarter, the score was opened again.
