On May 1, according to the famous ESPN reporter Nick depaula, Vanessa, the widow of Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, announced through personal social media that she would release mambacita clothing series on May 1, local time, that is, Gianna's 15th birthday, which is also in memory of her late daughter Gianna.

"Vanessa's creation of a clothing brand for her daughter will not only make us remember Gigi more, but also have a huge impact, because the whole proceeds of clothing will go to Mamba & mambacita sports foundation." Nick depaula reports.

After Kobe and Gianna died in a helicopter crash, Vanessa used many ways to remember them. Last month, she also had a mambacita tattoo on her arm in memory of her late daughter. Mambacita is Gianna's nickname. According to reports, Kobe submitted a document with Gigi's nickname "mambacita" as a registered trademark on December 30, 2019. In the document, Kobe plans to print "mambacita" on all kinds of sportswear, including sweatshirts, shirts, shorts, hats, sports pants, etc.
