On May 1, according to a report by the famous reporter of the Olympic, Samas chalaniya, a well-informed person revealed that if the pre game warm-up is completed as planned, the superstar LeBron James of the Lakers is expected to come back in today's game.

Today, the Lakers will play the kings at home. Sources said James is likely to complete his comeback today. According to the plan, James will test his ankle when warming up before the game and decide whether to play before the game. At the same time, the Laker team official also upgrades James's condition to go out to fight into the doubt.

James has been absent for 20 consecutive games since he suffered a high sprain of his right ankle on March 21. During this period, the record of the Lakers is only 8-13 (including the loss to the hawks in the injured game), and the offensive efficiency is the second lowest in the league, only better than that of the thunder.

It is reported that if James does not come back today, he is likely to return in the next game against the Raptors.

Why choose to come back at this time? One NBA reporter said: "I think LeBron feels a real sense of urgency. The Lakers have lost four of their last five games, and the fifth place in the west is unstable. Considering the struggling performance of the team, LeBron is eager to play. He has been absent for the longest time in his career. But I was told that what LeBron and the Lakers want to avoid most is that LeBron's ankle sprain won't recur, that it won't continue to haunt him, and that it won't happen in the playoffs

According to a tip from the Los Angeles Times, James trained for about an hour at the Lakers training center today and plans to arrive at Staples Center three hours before the game to warm up.

James, 36, has played 41 games so far this season, averaging 33.9 minutes, handing in 25.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists and 1.05 steals.
