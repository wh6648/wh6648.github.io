The Hawks, who have been plagued by injuries recently, have played the 76ers for the second time in three days. As one of the best teams in the East, the 76ers naturally need to consolidate their own ranking at the end of the regular season and launch an impact on the first position in the East. The eagles wanted to attack the upper part of the East, but they were short of major generals. It seemed that they could hardly resist the 76 men in full condition.

But after the start of the game, the 76ers seemed completely unprepared for the game. First they picked and rolled and emptied Trey young, then they kept throwing rebounds. Capella was like entering a no man's land under the basket and succeeded in two successive attacks. In the face of breakthrough, after contraction, there was no defensive player rotation to the outside line defense, and the three-point line was also shot through. Eagles play with the wind and the water, flowering inside and outside, at one stroke to play 13-2 start. Fortunately, in the second half of the first quarter, the substitute performance of the 76ers was still positive, while Capella on the Hawks side got into foul trouble early in the melee with nbid, which also gave the 76ers more opportunities to attack the interior. With Howard's free throw, the 76ers were 23-26 down in the first quarter.

As soon as the second quarter came up, the Hawks' embarrassing situation was revealed. Under the leadership of George Hill and Howard, the 76ers' substitute plastic surgery was full of momentum. Howard was even more powerful in the interior line, scoring continuously under the basket. The second attack destroyed the 76ers' interior line and helped the 76ers to surpass the score by a wave of 10-2. Hawks see the situation is not good, can only be replaced in advance Trey - Yang, help the team stabilize the situation. But Howard has no one to stop in the interior, 2 + 1 scored again, poor Eagle Capella got into foul trouble, facing the interior rampant Howard has no way. The advantage of the inside line also radiated to the outside line. Seth curry and Harris hit three points in succession, and the difference was directly pulled to 20 points. Fortunately, at the last moment, Trey young caused a foul, which reduced the midfield score to less than 20 points, and the Hawks fell behind by 46-65.

Yi Bian fought again. When Capella was able to play, the two sides began to attack each other. On this side, curry and Harris scored continuously. Over there, Capella and Trey young are no less, with both inside and outside lines blooming. However, the 76ers obviously won't give up the lead easily. Enbid shows the strength of MVP level. The inside can use the pace and feel to punch the card. Pekka doesn't say that the outside can also spend money to throw three points. This has caused a huge blow to the Hawks' defensive system and also made the 76ers' offensive system run smoothly. Fortunately, the Hawks found the offensive feel in the third quarter, scoring and 76 people to hold, did not let the score be further opened, with Solomon Hill free throw hit, the Hawks will catch up with the score to 77-94.

At the end of the game, Howard continued his excellent performance, even played the performance of folding rod in the air, and then rebounded twice under the basket. As soon as the Hawks saw that the trend had gone, they did not let the main players play again. The whole fourth quarter became the training ground for the substitute players, and the game was basically out of suspense. In the end, the 76ers beat the Hawks 126-104, ushering in a three game winning streak.

76 Starters: Joel enbid, Tobias Harris, Ben Simmons, Seth curry, Denny green.
