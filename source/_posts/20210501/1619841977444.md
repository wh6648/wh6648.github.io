It is reported on May 1 that the NBA regular season will continue today. Before the game between the nets and the Blazers, Nets coach Nash spoke in an interview about the injuries of the team's two superstars.

Asked whether harden will return in the regular season, Nash said: "I don't know if I want to make a prediction here, let's avoid this problem. I'm not sure if harden will return before the playoffs. He is making progress, let's wait and see."

Nash made it clear that harden "is still early to return", although he later said: "he is getting better and it is still a long time before we see him back on the pitch."

Speaking of Durant's situation, Nash said: "Durant feels very good today. He hopes to play tonight, but I stopped him."
