Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James has been in the headlines since high school, almost 24 hours a day in the spotlight. Of course, sometimes social media can bring him some trouble. James recently tweeted a picture of an Ohio police officer who shot and killed a 16-year-old black girl and wrote, "you're next." the tweet was later deleted.

Although the tweet has been deleted, it has caused heated discussion. According to MSN, a bar owner in Cincinnati, Ohio, said he would not broadcast NBA games unless LeBron James was expelled from the league.

"If anyone wants to watch NBA games, please don't come to Linnie's pub." Jay Linneman, owner of a Cincinnati bar, wrote on Facebook about James' controversial comments: "unless LeBron James is expelled from the NBA, we will not broadcast these games."

"Damn it! I wanted to go there for a drink tonight and watch our game James responded.

When the Ohio incident was first reported, many thought the policeman mistakenly shot and killed a 16-year-old girl. But when police arrived at the scene, following the exposure of the video from the camera, they found ma'khia Bryant stabbing his partner with a knife. James' initial reaction was based on his first report of the incident, and then he tried to clarify his previous tweet with another message.

"I'm fed up with black people being killed by the police. I deleted that tweet because it was used to create more hatred. It's not about one policeman, it's about the whole system. They always use our words to create more racism. I am very eager to have more responsibilities. I'm still upset about the little girl, and I feel sorry for her family James wrote.
