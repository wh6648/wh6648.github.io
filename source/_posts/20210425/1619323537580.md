April 25 news, according to "the Olympic" reporter shams charania and Joshua Robbins joint report, Orlando Magic coach Steve Clifford new coronavirus test positive.

Magic hope coach Clifford's new crown test result is false positive, because Clifford has been vaccinated with the first dose of new crown vaccine, there are no symptoms. ESPN reported that the test result of the new coronavirus is uncertain. If the test result is negative twice before the start of the game, Clifford can coach tomorrow's game.

It is worth mentioning that Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle once tested positive for the new coronavirus, which prevented him from attending the game between the team coaching in Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks. Carlisle said in an interview that the test results of the new coronavirus were "unexpected" because he received the new coronavirus vaccine in January.
