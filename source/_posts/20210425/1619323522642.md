On April 25, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jennie bass revealed that they were making a nine episode documentary about the Los Angeles Lakers while participating in the "all the smoke" podcast.

When Jerry Buss (died in 2013) bought the Lakers in 1979, they became a real glamour team in the NBA and one of the pillars of the league. Jerry Buss turned the Lakers into a must see TV show for fans. His intelligence and business acumen made the team famous all over the world. The story of the Lakers has become a household name. When joining Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson's "all the smoke" podcast, the owner of the Lakers, Jennie bass, revealed that they are making a nine episode documentary about the Lakers.

"We're making a nine episode documentary about the Lakers, starting with my father (Jerry bass) buying the team in 1979. I think a lot of people love "the last dance" (Jordan Documentary), so we're going to give our fans what they really want... Such a documentary will focus on telling stories, from buying this team from my father until we won the championship last year, all of which will be intertwined. My father hoped that one day I could manage the team with the magician. It was the return of the magician, who stood by my side and fought side by side with me, who helped me make the necessary changes to make the team competitive again. So my father really saw it Jennie Bass said.

Obviously, such a documentary about the Lakers will cause a huge sensation among the fans, especially with the passage of time, many things have not been widely reported or forgotten. In addition, Jennie Bass said that the upcoming documentary is different from HBO's Laker theme play. The play is adapted from the Showtime period of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, inspired by the biography of Jeff Perlman published in 2014: "Showtime: magic, Kareem, Riley, and the Los Angeles Lakers dynamics of the 1980s".
