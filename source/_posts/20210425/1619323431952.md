April 25, 2020-21 season NBA regular season continues, Los Angeles Lakers away game Dallas lone ranger. At the end of the game, the Lakers lost 93-108 to the lone ranger and suffered three consecutive losses.

This battle, the thick eyebrow elder brother resurfaces the second game, the condition is still low, he 19 shoots only 5, obtains 17 points 3 backboard 3 assists.

Full wait for more than two months, Anthony - Davis finally came back in the game.

However, in the first game of his comeback, it was inevitable that he was unfamiliar with his skills. He played half-time and was in poor condition. He only got 4 points, 4 rebounds, 1 steals, 1 blocks and 2 in 10 shots.

In the game, brother Nongmei has been shaking his head for his depression. When he was replaced, he also kicked the billboard severely. In addition, when facing dongqiqi and polzinghis, a lone ranger, his thick eyebrows were blocked and shot in the face, which made him lose face.

Come to today's game, the same venue, the same opponent. But the situation of thick eyebrow is still not good.

In the first quarter, the first two shots of brother Nongmei hit iron again. The only thing to be thankful for is that after that, he grabbed the rebounds from the front court and hit the ball hard in the second attack. And in the defensive end, the deterrent force of thick eyebrow finally began to appear.

Although, from the personal data of brother Nongmei, this deterrent is not obvious, but the score is not a lie. The second quarter, the Lakers completely get rid of the mess of the ball, and gradually establish a solid advantage.

During this period, brother Nongmei knew that he didn't feel good, so he took the initiative to seek confrontation and scored by making fouls and free throws. In the interior, the division of labor between Nongmei and Zhuang Shen is also very clear. Zhuang Shen mainly protects the rebounds, while Nongmei's task is to protect the basket and make up the defense. This rapid chemical reaction is still surprising.

However, as one of the core of the Lakers, it's obviously not enough for him to make this contribution. Especially in the attack, the Lakers need him to score a string of points, need him to return to the average 20 +, or even 25 + level.

But obviously, this night, in the attack, the situation of brother Nongmei is still not good. Although the second quarter, the thick eyebrow elder brother throws, the jump shot + the hook hand obtains 6 points continuously, the individual score on double. But his hand didn't continue. In the second half, he fell into the iron curse,

Of course, this downturn is understandable. After all, brother Nongmei suffered from Achilles tendon injury, which doomed him to pay enough attention to the injured parts. On the other hand, due to a long time injury, the thick eyebrow after comeback, the rhythm of the game must need some adjustment.

After all, to be back on the court is a good start for the black eyebrows and the Lakers.
