On July 3, according to a report from Yahoo Sports, Stan van Gundy talked about his coaching experience in Pelican after just one year in a guest show.

During this period, JVG clarified that he was not forced by the players after class. In particular, he stressed that this class ending had nothing to do with the pelican's core Zion Williamson.

"Zion and his family had nothing to do with my leaving New Orleans."

"I hate it when it happens to the players, it makes them look bad and I don't think it's fair. Of course, players have the right to express their views to others, but the management and the boss are the ones who make the decision. They are the ones who decide to fire employees, which should not be imposed on players

Before that, it was reported that panghu's camp didn't want him to stay in New Orleans any more. One of the important reasons was related to the coaching style of JVG. Panghu's family believed that JVG's coaching style was too strict. At the end of the season, Pelican fired Da Fan for the first time, hoping to keep panghu's heart.

But in today's interview, JVG denied all this. He said, "Zion is not a coach killer. He is a person who can help you win a lot of games. He has been playing in the right way."

Although he didn't have much success in leading the team, in the first two seasons of his career, Zion has shown his talent in pelicans. This season, he has also been selected into the all star team.

In the regular season, in Zion's 61 games, he averaged 27 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.9 steals, 0.6 blocks and 61.1% shooting percentage. He became the first player who averaged at least 25 points and more than 60% shooting percentage after Kevin McHale in 1986-87 season.
