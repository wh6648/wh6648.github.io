On July 3, ESPN, a well-known American sports media, published an article that revealed that bull core Zac Lavin would refuse the team's four-year $105 million early contract extension.

Analysts revealed that Raven did not want to leave Chicago, but did not want to renew his contract ahead of time. Because according to the labor agreement, by next summer, when Raven becomes a full free agent, he is expected to sign a bigger contract for up to five years, with a total value of up to $204 million.

This past season, for Laven, is the most breakthrough season in his career. In the regular season, he played 58 games, with an average score of 27.4 points. After seven years of hard work, Laven has finally become one of the top scorers recognized by the whole league.

In addition to scoring, raven averaged 4.9 assists per game, which is also a career high. His average three-point shooting rate is the first time to break through the 40% mark. In addition, raven's first All-Star career, but also to fill one of his major shortcomings.

However, next season, raven's salary is only $19.5 million, which obviously does not match his real stadium value.

In fact, the bulls have always attached great importance to keeping Raven. In order to help Raven impact the playoffs, in the middle of this season, the Bulls launched a big deal, poached the magic core Nicolas vucevich. But, unfortunately, the Bulls' efforts failed to help them get a playoff ticket.

At the end of the season, news came out that it was not good for the bulls. It was reported that Raven sold his house in Chicago at a loss, which made many people worry whether he was planning to play elsewhere.

Theoretically speaking, if Raven refuses to renew his contract this year, then next summer, when he becomes a full free agent, he will definitely have more than one option for the bulls. It is also possible for him to choose other cities as the next stop of his career.

However, ESPN's article has sent a positive signal to the bulls. The article thinks that the reason why the bulls are willing to give up two future first round signings and exchange for vucevic before the trade deadline is probably because they have reached a tacit agreement with raven. In the future, Chicago is still Raven's first choice.
