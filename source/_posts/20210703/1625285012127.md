On July 3, according to reports from the US media, Sun Star Chris Paul's brother CJ Paul revealed in an interview that his brother once regarded the Houston Rockets as the last leg of his career.

But later, Paul only stayed in the Rockets for two seasons and was involved in the deal again and sent to the thunder.

Looking back on his younger brother Chris's career, CJ Paul has a lot of feelings. He said, "it's really a long process. I'm really happy that he has the chance to win the championship and all his efforts have been rewarded. Think about it. The Rockets said they would not trade Chris. "

"But now, he is leading a team that would never have played three or four years ago to the finals CJ Paul said.

"We thought Houston was the last stop, but now there are two more. We enjoy it. I'm happy for Chris."

In fact, when Paul was traded to the Rockets in 2017, he was 32 years old. At that time, many people looked down on his career prospects.

But in the following season, Paul and harden led the team to play the Rockets' best regular season record. In the playoffs, they pushed the extremely gorgeous warriors into a desperate situation, once leading 3-2 to get the match point. But later, because Paul hamstring injury, the Rockets regret out.

In the summer of 2018, the Rockets struck while the iron was hot and reached a four-year $160 million contract extension with Paul. Who would have thought that this contract, however, made CP3 a laughing stock for a long time. 18-19 season, Paul and harden conflict, the Rockets also early out of the playoffs.

After that, Paul was traded to thunder, and then moved to suns last summer. For a time, there was not much hope for his career. But now, in the sun, Paul has proved his worth again.
