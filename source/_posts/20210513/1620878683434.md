Heat officials announced today that defender Victor oradibo will undergo a right quadriceps tendon repair operation in New York on Friday to determine the season reimbursement.

It's not good news for oradipo himself and the heat. At this stage, there is no specific timetable for oradipo's return.

Oradipo was injured in the game against the Lakers on April 9. In the fourth quarter of the match, oradipo injured his knee when he slammed to the ground, and then returned to the dressing room accompanied by the staff.

In January, oradipo was sent to Houston as one of the chips in a four party deal involving James Harden. On the closing day of the season, oradipo was sent to Miami by the Rockets.

After coming to the heat, oradibo played only four games, averaging 27.8 minutes, handing over 12.0 points, 3.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.75 steals.

Oradipo will become a free agent this summer. His goal is to get a long-term top salary contract in the off-season. Therefore, he rejected the rocket's early contract extension. But considering oradipo's injury history, the probability of getting a long-term top salary contract this year has dropped sharply.
