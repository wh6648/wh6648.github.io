In the off-season, Russell Westbrook left the team. In January this year, James Harden was traded away. In the case of constant injuries, the Rockets experienced a low season. At present, the rocket team's record is 16-53, which has been locked at the bottom of the league in advance.

"I never thought that even though I would be so depressed in the face of defeat, I could feel so good in a season with 16 wins," fertita said. "But when I see that we have a lot of draft power and a bright future, I'm really happy."

"I know it's unusual for me to be bad with the management and the coach, but that's how I feel," feldita continued. "By 2027, we may get a top 5 draft signing and pick a good young man. I don't know why, but we're on the right track

"Yes, I'm proud of the team management and the coaching staff, who keep showing me that they're doing the right thing," fertita said.

Fertita said he was patient with the future of the Rockets¡° I'll be patient, and my guys know what they're doing, "feldita said." we're not going to be stupid enough to try to play in the playoffs next season, which will only stop us from competing for the championship in the next few years. "
