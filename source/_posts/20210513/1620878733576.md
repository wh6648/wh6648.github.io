May 13 news, January 26, 2020, Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and daughter Gianna, a total of nine people were killed in the helicopter crash. What makes people angry is that many law enforcement officers took photos of the scene and shared them on the Internet. The lawyer for Kobe's widow Vanessa said in a court document that the fire department investigation concluded that the photos taken by the two firefighters at the scene of Kobe's crash were "not commercially necessary.".

According to court documents filed this week, the Los Angeles County Fire Department plans to fire two of the firefighters and suspend one of them on suspicion of taking photos of the crash site of Kobe's helicopter and sharing them with their wives and girlfriends.

According to the report, the Fire Department concluded after investigation that they (firefighters) took photos of Kobe's crash scene "without business necessity" and "just to satisfy their desires and achieve visual gossip". In a statement, Vanessa's team of lawyers said they supported the postponement of the trial to allow time for further investigation. The Los Angeles County attorney argued that Vanessa's lawsuit had no legal basis because the photos had not been published and she could not sue for "hypothetical harm" that might have been shared publicly.

The third firefighter was a public relations officer sent to the scene to interact with the media, according to court documents. The names of the three firefighters have not been released and their employment status is unclear. It is worth mentioning that Ron Haralson, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, declined to comment on the case on the grounds of pending litigation, and could not confirm whether the three firefighters had been fired or punished. The union, which represents Los Angeles County firefighters, also did not respond to requests for comment.

It is worth mentioning that when Kobe's helicopter crashed, no less than eight policemen took photos of Kobe's remains with their mobile phones and spread them. Vanessa then sued the Los Angeles County Police Department and a number of people involved in the case. In the end, Vanessa won the lawsuit. In March this year, Vanessa announced the contents of the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, the four derelict police officers who leaked photos of Kobe's plane crash were Raul versales, Rafael Mejia, Joey Cruz and Michael Russell.

Vanessa's team of lawyers then filed a revised lawsuit, listing the names of four derelict police officers and making detailed charges against each. Ron Hernandez, President of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Association, previously declined to say whether the officer Vanessa named had been disciplined, was on duty, or even was still working at the police station.

"As far as we know, the investigation is still in progress." Ron Hernandez said in a statement.

In a subsequent submission, Vanessa's legal team said that through the internal documents of the police department and the fire department, they learned that as many as 66 employees knew about the photos, and that at least 18 employees, including four deputies, had taken or shared the photos directly. Vanessa's lawyer had previously said in court documents that the sheriff's order to delete the photos was an attempt to destroy the evidence.
