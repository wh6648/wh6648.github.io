On May 13, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued, with the Los Angeles Lakers playing the Houston Rockets at home.

Before the game, the Lakers' home Staples Center raised the banner of the championship of last season, that is, the 2019-20 season.

This is the 17th championship flag in the history of the Lakers, which also makes them tied with Celtic to become the most championship team in NBA history.

The Lakers waited until the end of the regular season to raise the flag of last season's championship over Staples Center. The reason the Lakers want to do this is to share the joy with the fans.

As we all know, the NBA has experienced many changes since it was attacked by the epidemic in March last year. After the suspension and resumption of work, the game began to go on empty court. For a year, there were almost no spectators on the scene.

But recently, as the epidemic in the United States has eased, NBA venues have opened one after another, and an appropriate number of spectators can come to the scene to cheer for their home team, including the Laker fans. And the purple gold army raised the champion flag at this time, just waiting for the witness.

In fact, before and after the flag raising ceremony, the owner of the Los Angeles team, Jennie bass, two core players, James, and big brow all spoke one after another. Without exception, they all talked about the fans, saying that this championship is dedicated to all the fans of the Los Angeles team.

In his speech, brother Nongmei expected that the Staples Center, as one of the most noisy NBA stadiums in the past, could quickly resume its prosperity.
