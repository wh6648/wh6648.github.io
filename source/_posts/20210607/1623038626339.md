After the game, George said some words of encouragement to Dong Qiqi, and then gave his shirt to the Slovenian young man. However, Dong Qiqi did not give his shirt to George, but continued to congratulate and talk with other Los Angeles players.

"Did Luca doncic forget to exchange jerseys£¨ "Two smiles and tears," house of highlights wrote.

Of course, many people have responded to the actions of the lone ranger superstar.

However, at a post match press conference, Dong clarified what happened and said he just didn't want to exchange jerseys with George on the court. When he returned to the dressing room, he exchanged jerseys with George.

"We did exchange, and then I gave one in the dressing room." Dongqiqi said.
