On June 7, it was reported that the last game of the first round of NBA playoffs in the western region was between the clippers and the lone ranger. The Clippers star Leonard played a dominant performance on both ends of the attack and defense, scoring 28 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists and 4 steals in 10 of 15 shots, leading the Clippers to beat the lone ranger 126-111, and eliminated the opponent 4-3 in total score, meeting the Jazz in the Western semi-finals.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Leonard didn't make any attempt to open the scoring mode immediately. Aiming at the weakness of the opponent's joint defense, he made two mid-range jump shots and made three-point accurate hits in the attack defense conversion. On the defensive end, Leonard also personally took on the task of marking Dong Qiqi, but he did not cause too much trouble to Dong Qiqi, who felt hot and scored three points. In the second half of this section, Leonard still led the team from the offensive end. After finishing 1-0 dunk in the counterattack, he was not satisfied. He also challenged Smith to finish violent one arm dunk. At the end of the first quarter, the clippers were 3 points behind the lone ranger.

Entering the second quarter, seeing George take over the team's attack, Cary decisively gave up the ball and focused on defending Dong Qiqi, which effectively limited the opponent's attack. At the same time, he can also use his personal impact to create opportunities for his teammates, sending three assists in a single quarter. After half-time, the Clippers beat the score 70-62.

After another fight on the other side, Leonard took the lead in the middle distance jump shot. Then he caught the ball in the bottom corner and passed Boban one step. Through Poshen, he finished the double hand smashing, which ignited the atmosphere to the climax. Then Leonard took the initiative to attack the interior line, even shot with a penalty to get 5 points, the end of the three quarters of the game, the Clippers lead to 12 points.
