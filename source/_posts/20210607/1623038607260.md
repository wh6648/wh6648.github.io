Talking about the harvest of this season, Dong Qiqi said: "you can learn different things all the time. There's a big difference between the playoffs and the regular season. It's a tough game to fight for seven. You have to give everything. This result is not what we want, we will make a comeback next season

Dong Qiqi played a very amazing data in this series, averaging 35.7 points, 7.9 rebounds, 10.3 assists, and 46 points in this game. For his own data, Dong Qiqi said: "I haven't finished anything. I've made two playoffs in the lone ranger, and both of them are first round exits, so we haven't finished anything. You're paid to win, so you need to keep working
