ESPN reporter Dave McMenamin reported on June 7 that although the Los Angeles Lakers were out in the first round of the playoffs, rob palinka, the team's vice president and general manager of basketball operations, said in a video conference that their goal in the off-season period is to keep the core lineup intact.

"I think it makes you more motivated when you don't reach your goals. I think we don't form a complete team in most cases, which is part of our motivation in a sense Palinka said.

Palinka also very much agree with coach Vogel and superstars LeBron James, Anthony Davis point of view, they believe that if the team did not encounter injury attack, the Lakers still have the chance to impact the championship.

"I'm sure that if we don't have these unforeseen conditions this year, we will be a championship level team. So, our goal is to keep the core lineup intact Palinka continued.

With James, Anthony Davis, Pope and Kyle Kuzma signing more than $100 million, palinka was asked if he had the approval of the team owner to retain some key players who would become free agents.

"One of the things that Jennie bass and the group's owners empower management is to build a big list of champions," he said "Of course, I hope all of our fans will come back next year and become part of the team building," he said. We have a responsibility to get them to start again and have a champion team that can do something special next year. That's the driving force between Jennie, the executive and the coach, and that's our goal forever. "

Palinka also made clear the goal of the team: "we have the insatiable desire and the passion to bring the 18th Championship flag here. We are excited about the work to start tomorrow, not only for our team, but also for our fans

The Lakers used Denny green as their main bargaining chip in the off-season last year to exchange Schroeder, who has one year left on his contract, from the thunder. It has been reported that the Lakers offered Schroeder a four-year $84 million early contract extension in the middle of the season, but it was rejected. Speaking of this, Schroeder explained: "let me make this clear first. I didn't refuse to postpone because I was in trade negotiations. I also have a team in Germany, so he understands the rules of the industry and he would do the same. I refused to renew my contract because I was involved in Kyle Lowry's trade negotiations at that time

Schroeder said his relationship with palinka is very strong¡° I've been in close touch with Rob throughout the season and you can't ask for more than that. That's never changed Schroeder said.

Palinka also talked a lot about the benefits Schroeder brought to the team¡° I think all of us can see the performance of Dennis (Schroeder), he is a competitor, on both sides of the offensive and defensive. He brings energy on the defensive end, and of course he has the ability to score. We value these qualities of him. August is August, a few months before the free market. We need to evaluate a lot of different things, but Dennis is an attractive player for us and he can bring a lot of benefits to the team Palinka said.
