On May 16, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued. At the end of today's game, there are still many possibilities for the final ranking of the East.

1. The Philadelphia green army has no desire and no desire

Yesterday, the 76ers had secured first place in the East after beating the magic. Even if the nets win in the last game and Philadelphia loses, Philadelphia's 2-1 nets in the regular season can still push the opponent to the top of the table.

Celtic also have no desire, they have locked in the eastern seventh, determined to play a playoff, the final result of the first World War, will not have any impact on their ranking.

2. Nets win second

The nets and bucks both won today, so their second or third place has not been scheduled. The nets have to beat the Cavaliers if they want to be second in the East. Once the nets lose, the Bucks beat the bulls, and the two teams share equally. The Bucks' regular season record is 2-1 nets, and the ranking will exceed.

3.4, 5 fierce competition

After today's competition, the Knicks and the Hawks have the same record of 40 wins. With the advantage of win-win relationship, the Knicks are in fourth place and the Hawks are in fifth place. The heat are still 39 wins after losing to bucks, ranking sixth for the time being.

Considering the sixth team, the first round of the playoffs is likely to play with the nets or bucks, therefore, in the final game, these three teams will still strive to win, and strive to make their ranking come to the fourth or fifth place, and avoid strong opponents in the first round.

In the last battle, the Knicks' opponent is Celtic, the Hawks' opponent is the Rockets, and the heat will fight the pistons.

Finally, all the ranking possibilities are shown in Figure 1

(Note: compared with the win-win relationship in the regular season, the Knicks 3-0 hawks, the Knicks 0-3 heat, the Hawks 2-1 heat, in the case of three teams with the same score, the Hawks is the champion of the southeast region, ranking the top, followed by the heat, and then the Knicks)

4. The wizard is determined by the wasp

The Hornets, the Pacers and the wizards, who rank No. 8, No. 9 and No. 10, are sure to play in the playoffs. But after today's game, the three teams all won 33, with the same record and small points. The Hornets temporarily ranked 8th, the Wizards 9th and the Pacers 10th.

In the last game, the wizard talks directly with the Hornets, while the walker's opponent is the Raptors.
