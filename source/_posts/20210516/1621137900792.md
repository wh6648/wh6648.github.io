On May 16, reports from the US media said that in the penultimate World War II of this season's regular season, the Lakers beat the Pacers away to win four games in a row. This victory allowed the defending champion to continue to fight for the sixth place in the West.

After today's win, the Los Angeles team's record came to 41-30, ranking seventh in the western region, and its record was the same as that of the Blazers, who ranked No.6 in the western region. So how can the Lakers avoid leaving the playoff?

According to the schedule, the Lakers will play pelicans next Monday, while the Blazers will play Nuggets at home. The two focus games will start at 9 am at the same time.

If the Lakers win the pelicans and the Trail Blazers lose to the Nuggets, they will be sixth in the West. In this way, the Lakers will play the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.

As long as the Blazers win, they will be sixth in the west, and the Lakers will play the playoff as seventh in the West. If the Lakers win the playoff, they will play the Suns or jazz in the first round of the playoffs.
