On May 16, it was reported that Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant was officially selected into the Naismith Basketball Hall of fame in 2020. Kobe's wife Vanessa delivered a touching award-winning speech on behalf of him. This 15 minute speech filled everyone's eyes with tears.

Vanessa, wearing a purple dress symbolizing the Lakers, appeared on the stage. As Kobe's introducer, Michael Jordan stood beside Vanessa all the way. In her speech, Vanessa expressed her gratitude to Jordan, her yearning for Kobe and Gianna, and her eyes were once full of tears.

After the strong Vanessa came on stage, she first said "I have no problem, I love you" to everyone in the audience, just like talking with Kobe in heaven.

"Last December, I called Michael (JORDAN) and asked him if he would like to be Kobe's introducer. He didn't hesitate to accept it." Then Vanessa turned to Jordan and said, "thank you, Michael. Kobe adores you very much, which means a lot to us

"I've never praised my husband publicly in the past because I think he has received enough praise from fans all over the world and someone has to bring him back to real life. But today I want to do that, and now I believe he's laughing in heaven, too, because I'm going to celebrate his legendary career on this stage. I can see that he is crossing his hands, cracking his mouth and saying with a smile, "isn't that fun?" Vanessa mocked Kobe's tone, which also received warm applause and cheers.

"He still won." Vanessa said, "I really hope my husband can accept this incredible honor here. He and Gigi deserve to be here to witness it. Gigi, seeing her father in the basketball hall of fame, she would be very proud. I know Kobe must be looking forward to coming here. On this holy night, thank my parents for bringing one of the most amazing people into the world. Thanks to PAM and Joe for making Kobe an outstanding player. Thank you to all of Kobe's family. You are beyond everything. I love you

"There will never be anyone like Kobe again. Kobe is unique. He's special, he's humble off the court, but he's bigger than life. To all of you who are here, thank you. I know Kobe is very grateful for what you've done for his daughters. I love you and will always be grateful to you. If my husband were here tonight, he would have a series of words that inspired him to qualify for the hall of fame, family, friends, mentors, Laker teammates and opponents. It's one of the many difficulties for them not to be here. At the risk of missing anyone, I can only say, thank you. All the people who helped him get to this point, you know who you are, and I think you represent him. " Said Vanessa.

"My husband didn't prepare a speech for me because every speech he gave was improvised. He is smart, eloquent, and gifted in many ways, including public speaking. I know that he will thank everyone who has helped him reach his present level, including those who question him and oppose him, and those who tell him that he can't achieve his goal. At the same time, he will thank all those who inspired him to come here. After all, he proved that those who questioned him were wrong. " Vanessa continued.

"All hall of fame athletes have one thing in common, that is, they have to sacrifice a part of their lives to invest more time in their technology. It requires a lot of self drive, dedication and self-discipline, and no one can take away their success. Kobe's personal data says it all. Kobe has never taken a shortcut since he started playing basketball. He is full of awe for the game. For example, after Kobe's injury, food poisoning and flu, he needs to receive intravenous injection for a long time to continue the game. If he broke his finger, he would pull it back. When his fingers recovered, he taught himself how to play with his left hand. Even after rupturing his Achilles tendon, he insisted on finishing two free throws before leaving the field on his own. I'll never forget that game, the way he looked at me when he left the field, I know it was bad. Everyone was cheering, and I assured Gianna that Dad would be OK, just like everyone else was hurt. But he walked into the player's aisle and didn't look at me or kiss me. I could see the concern on his face. The injury was really serious Vanessa recalled.

"You don't know that one of the reasons my husband is playing with pain is that he said he remembered when he was a child, sitting in the stands with his father and watching his favorite players play." Vanessa said and peeked at Jordan, which made the guests laugh. "He recalled the trip and the excitement of having a seat on the court. Kobe doesn't want to disappoint the fans. I asked him why he didn't rest after being injured? His answer is: "if I'm out, what about the fans who save money to watch me play just once? He has never forgotten his fans. If he can do it, he will devote himself to every minute of every game and he loves you very much. Kobe has many achievements, including five NBA championships, 18 all stars, two Olympic gold medalists, and the first professional athlete to win an Oscar... There are many such achievements, but his most cherished achievement is to be the best father. I thank my husband, who has done a lot of work, broken a lot of records and inspired countless people to become greater. "

"I want to thank him because he's not only a great athlete, but he's also trying to give. A visionary entrepreneur and a great Houseman. Dear Kobe, thank you for being the best husband and father you can be. Thank you for growing and learning from your mistakes. Thank you for inspiring us to be better every day. Thank you for never giving up on us. Thank you for all your hard work. Thank you for giving us this family. Thank you for all you've done for our daughters: Natalia, Gianna, Bianca and CAPRI (nicknamed Koko). Thank you for working tirelessly to bring us the best life. Thank you for getting up at 4 a.m. to train, coming home in the morning to kiss me, sending your daughters to school, and picking up our daughter from school at any time. Thank you for never missing a birthday, a dance show, a school awards ceremony, an exhibition or a story show. If time permits, you will never miss any of your daughters' games. Thank you for putting our love first, for bringing so much joy to our lives, for bringing so much joy to people all over the world, for inspiring us to do better than yesterday, for teaching me and all of us to put other people's happiness above our own. " Vanessa continued.

"Thank you for being so selfless and loving like gold. Thank you for never taking yourself too seriously, for your humor, for your wit. Thank you for never saying "no" to me, and most of the time you always let me do what I want. Thank you for your patience, thank you for letting me crack your trick at the first chance, and thank you for generously accepting all my refutations. Thank you for the joy you have brought me. Thank you for loving me forever. Bianca and Capri, I'm glad you're here tonight. Dad is incredible. He loves you so much Vanessa said.

"Congratulations, baby. All your efforts and sacrifices have paid off. You once said to me, "if you want to win or lose, bet on yourself." I'm glad you bet on yourself. You are so outstanding. You did it. You're in the basketball hall of fame now. You're a real Championship player, you're not just an MVP, you're a great player in NBA history. I'm proud of you. I love you forever. Kobe Bean Bryant. " Vanessa said at last.
