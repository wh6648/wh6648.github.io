Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant has a great NBA career. The five time NBA champion obviously has a more ambitious plan for his second daughter Gigi's career. In recent Adrian wojnarowski's "woj pod" show, former Michael Jordan and Kobe's trainer Tim Grover revealed that Kobe wants his daughter Gigi to become the first female player in the NBA.

"This kind of" Mamba spirit "may not be seen on the basketball court, but from the spiritual point of view, it has never disappeared. In my opinion, Kobe has two goals. One is that his daughter (second daughter Gigi) became the first female player in NBA, not WNBA, but NBA. That's why he trained her; Second, he said, "in basketball, I have a lot of support from Los Angeles fans. After retirement, I want to have more wealth and fame in Los Angeles, whether it's Hollywood or my business empire. "

Tim Grover is a very famous NBA trainer. He has been the personal trainer of many NBA superstars, including Michael Jordan, Kobe, McGrady and Wade. Unfortunately, we can't see Kobe achieve his dream. Kobe will be inducted into the basketball hall of fame on Saturday, U.S. time, prompting more people to remember the black mamba on the court and what he did off the court.
