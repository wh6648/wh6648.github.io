After half of the eastern and Western finals, strange things are still happening.

On the west side, the Clippers seem to have fallen into a desperate situation when they are out of ammunition with a knee injury. But who would have thought that in the G5 battle of life and death, the Clippers staged a magical counter attack. Paul George was like Jordan and Kobe, and Lu's brocade bag had a clever plan. By activating koshins, he successfully saved a dead game. Although, after winning, the Clippers are still 2-3 behind, but they have successfully retained the promotion fire, also let this round of Western Conference to have a look again.

On the eastern side, the Bucks saw a good chance to win the match when G3 destroyed the eagles and Trey young retired with a foot injury. However, in G4, the eagles were full of fighting spirit. Looking back at the Bucks, the letter brother sprained his leg seriously in a defense in the third quarter, and instantly pulled the balance of the series back to the origin. Next, whether letters can return is a big question mark. Under the 2-2 balance of power, if the eagles deal with it well, and if Yang can make a comeback, then the trend of the whole round of the series may face new changes.

In other words, with the finals a step away, the title of this year's championship is still a huge puzzle. And the reason why the season will come to this step, the main reason is only one - injury.

A data show that after the letter brother retired from the game yesterday, before and after the start of the playoffs, up to nine core players have been injured.

In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers were the first to be possessed by the curse of injury. First, James came out with a high ankle sprain and couldn't get full. Then, thick eyebrow brother was knocked down by groin injury, can only be forced to sit on the bench. So it's no surprise that the Lakers lost to the Suns after six games.

A similar story happened in the second round. Originally, the nets were the number one favorite to win the championship this year after gathering together the big three. In the first two games of the series, they did not fight the bucks. However, starting from G3, Owen suffered from the "cushion" season. Then, harden came back with injuries, and his fighting power was seriously reduced. After that, we witnessed Durant's epic performance of playing the whole game twice, but we were also very sorry for the net's seven outs.

Of course, it's not only the Lakers and the nets that are affected by injuries. As early as before the start of the playoffs, the green shirt lacked the second leader, Jay brown, while Denver's second leader, Jamal Murray, lost the season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Originally, the Nuggets and the green army also have the strength to compete for the championship, but because of the residual battle, they entered the ranks of the out team early.

Nowadays, the curse of injury is still spreading. Among the four teams in the division finals, three of the leading stars have fallen one after another. It seems that only the Western suns survived Paul's shoulder injury crisis, the lineup configuration is still complete.

It's a pity that the star player's injury is stopped, but it has to be said that this year's play of "the rest is the king" has taken on a completely different look from the playoffs in previous years.

Injuries, of course, are not what all teams want to see, but injuries are never the reason to retreat and give up. In the past two days, the changes of the clippers and eagles in the desperate situation have made people marvel. Especially the clippers, after the difficult win of G5, also attracted Lu's emotional tears after the game.

It can be said that in the playoffs, it is very difficult for the four teams to take every step forward. What's more, no matter the sun is in good times, or the eagles, clippers and bucks are short of core, they don't know whether they will encounter new accidents in the next game, and they don't know how many dice they will throw next time. This year's playoffs, it is in this huge unknown, step by step in the direction of the grand finale slowly forward... (Poirot)
