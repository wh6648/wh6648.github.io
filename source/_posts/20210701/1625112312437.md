July 1 news, the eagles officially updated the injury list of the team today, in which Trey young and Clint Capella's status are doubtful (50% possible), Bogdan Bogdanovic is likely to play.

Yang missed the G4 on Wednesday because of a bruise to his right foot. Capella was stabbed in the right eye of G4 and now has inflammation in the right eye. What the outside world is most concerned about is, will the two core Eagles play in the battle of Tianwang mountain on Friday?

"I haven't talked to the trainer, so I don't know about them at the moment," Eagles coach Nate McMillan said.

G4 Janis adtokumbo injured his left knee. Talking about his first reaction after his injury, McMillan said: "of course, I'm worried. Although he is our opponent, I still respect him very much. Yes, you don't want anything bad to happen to anyone. "

"Whenever the whole bench and the coaching staff come together to care about a player's injury and the player has to be helped to leave the field, I worry about him," continued McMillan. "You don't want to see that happen. The alphabet is a big problem for us, but I still don't want to see it happen

The eagles fans applauded as he left. In response, McMillan said: "I have great respect for our fans, they support injured players, they don't want to see anyone injured."
