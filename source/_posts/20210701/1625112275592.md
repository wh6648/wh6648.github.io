On July 1, the Cleveland honest man reported that Kevin love's role in the Cavaliers is expected to be smaller in the 21-22 season, according to informed sources.

Cavaliers reporter Chris Fedor revealed that Lefu's role in the Cavaliers is expected to be smaller next season. Some on the team wonder if Larry NANs would be more efficient if he averaged 25 minutes a game.

In April of this year, in a regular season match between the Cavaliers and the Raptors, Lok Fu lost control of his mood when kicking off from the bottom line and made a careless mistake and directly opened the ball to his opponent. As a result, the Raptors seized the opportunity to hit three points.

At that time, the Cavaliers solved the problem of Lok Fu internally. Meanwhile, Lok Fu also apologized to the whole team. The occurrence of this incident shows that Lefu is depressed and unsuccessful in Cleveland.

At this stage, there is no source that Lok Fu is seeking a buyout or deal.

Lok Fu's current contract will expire in the summer of 2023. His salary for the 21-22 season was $31 million, and his salary for the 22-23 season was $28.9 million.

It is worth mentioning that Lefu has been selected into the U.S. men's basketball team. He will go to Tokyo Olympic Games with the team. American men's basketball general manager Jerry - colongelo said that this dream team needs Lefu, who has experience in international competitions.
