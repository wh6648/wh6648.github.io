Owen is the same Owen. He goes his own way and is the same on and off the court. Of course, eating fast and chanting Buddha does not delay the decision to kill, Owen's recent performance in the field is still strong at least. On May 12, 2021, the Nets beat the bulls 115-107. Owen scored 13 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists. He only played 21 minutes because of his opponent's elbow stroke and facial contusion.

In the first quarter, Owen didn't have much breakthrough attack with the ball. In the past few games, Owen's medium range shooting improved steadily, and he consciously reduced the frequency of breakthrough with the ball. As the playoffs approached, Owen knew that health was the first priority. However, in the first four minutes of the first quarter, Owen showed all kinds of shooting skills. In the first eight minutes, Owen hit a three-point catch and led the team to a climax, leading to 10 points in the first quarter.

As a playoff month in May, Owen has entered the state ahead of time. With an average of 32.4 points per game, 4-3 points per game and a abnormal shooting rate of more than 55%, Owen's early fire is absolutely the best news. In the first quarter, Owen had 13 points and 5 assists, which revitalized the attack rhythm of the whole team and made him the best player. And all along, Owen has been accused and criticized as a defensive black hole at the beginning of his career, which can be completely abandoned this season.

In the second quarter of 4 minutes and 14 seconds, Owen even fell to the ground from the back court in order to grab a Huichang ball, with a distance of 10 meters. Finally, he succeeded in grabbing the ball right for the net. Owen's defensive attitude and improvement are very important for the outside line of the net. After all, like Owen, harden has changed from a black hole to a misplaced defensive elite. At the beginning of the third quarter, Owen was directly hit in the face by opponent vucevic's elbow in a defensive fight. Owen lay on the ground for five minutes without getting up. Then Owen got up and went back to the dressing room. Finally, it was officially announced that Owen could not return because of a facial bruise.

I don't know if Owen will be absent in the next game of the nets. Fortunately, it's just a hard injury. In fact, Owen is not a very healthy star in his career. He hasn't played full-time in 10 years. The most frequent one is that he has played 75 games in 2015 season. In 10 seasons, Owen has only three 70 + appearances. Of course, Owen has been injured in many parts in his career, the most famous of which is his face. When he collided with his opponent, he broke his nose and played with a mask. At that time, he was still playing for Celtic. In the end, the nets won the Bulls without Owen and continued to press the bucks to occupy the second place in the East.
