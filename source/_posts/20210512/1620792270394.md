On May 12, according to the famous ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, the 30 day exclusive negotiation window for former MLB stars Alex Rodriguez and billionaire Marc lore to acquire Minnesota Timberwolves from Glen Taylor has ended, and no formal acquisition agreement has been reached.

According to sources, the two sides will continue to try to reach an agreement with sincerity, possibly extending the exclusive negotiation window, but there is no specific information yet.

Glen Taylor announced on April 10 local time that the Timberwolves would be sold to Alex Rodriguez and billionaire mark Lowe for about $1.5 billion, including debt. In addition, the deal also includes the acquisition of WNBA's Minnesota Bobcats. Two years after the acquisition, Alex Rodriguez and mark Lowe will become Taylor's limited partners until they take over the team completely in 2023-24.

Some of the talks over the past month have focused on securing that Taylor will transfer control on a specific date, the source said. Alex Rodriguez and mark Lowe met with Timberwolves staff last month and visited the team's facilities in Minneapolis.

In the past 10 years, Glen Taylor has held several exclusive negotiations with potential buyers. Last year, media reports said that an investment group led by former Memphis Grizzlies owner Daniel E. Straus had in-depth discussions with Taylor on the acquisition of Timberwolves and bobcats, but the negotiations eventually broke down. In addition, franchise icon Kevin Garnett has also expressed interest in forming a team to acquire Timberwolves. After the Timberwolves announced the resale to Alex Rodriguez and mark Lowe for $1.5 billion, Garnett immediately updated the social media and yelled at Taylor.

Glen Taylor bought the Timberwolves in 1994 to keep the team from moving to New Orleans. According to reports, Glen Taylor has stressed that all sale negotiations are based on keeping the team in Minnesota.
