Recently, Nash's slightly excessive use of Durant has caused controversy. Durant was exhausted in the second game of the game, especially in the last game. For the nets, the key is to protect and use Durant correctly. On May 12, 2021, the Nets beat the bulls 115-107. Durant played 32 minutes, setting a new low in the past seven games, scoring 21 points and 8 assists.

It's not easy for Nash to grasp Durant's strength and practice by the game. After entering may, Durant's average playing time is... Exaggerated nearly 40 minutes, which is far greater than Durant's average playing time of 33 minutes this season. Do you use it hard or put forward to enter the game to deal with the playoffs? This is the consensus and game between Durant and NASH.

Of course, although Durant hit the first goal after the start, he soon sent three assists in a row. After harden's comeback, Durant still played or occasionally played as a guest organization forward. In this game against the bulls, Durant was even arranged to the fifth position by Nash, the highest point of the game. However, Durant played a very cunning feint point. The nets even had as many as 11 assists behind the first 11 scores, all of which came from the passing ball and the scoring and shooting after opening the gap. Nash used Durant's "1000 methods" throughout the whole season.

So you will find that Durant has more functions in the recent competition. On the one hand, he spared no effort to preserve his physical fitness and protect himself. On the other hand, he tried to hit his opponent by dislocation as the highest link in the five small teams. The most intuitive attack, 9 minutes in the second quarter, the three line fast break of the net, Durant had the chance to dunk, but still hit the west to assist his teammates to dunk. After this ball, the net has been exaggerating 14 goals and 14 assists. After that, Durant quickly followed up and finished the smash.

In the second quarter, Durant became the core of attack and defense. That's what Nash wanted to see. In the middle of the circle, Durant made a solo Raven's no solution shot, a defensive block, a counter attack after the local counter attack, and three successful defense and two successful assists. After the director's little climax, the nets once led to 20 points. After the start of the second half, Owen's injury left Durant to take over the game again. The central shooting team made three consecutive shots to stop the bulls.

In the seventh minute of the third quarter, Durant once again displayed his ability of one key destruction in attack and defense. First, he nailed the big hat to Laven's layup in the process of back defense, then he hit a three-point shot in return, and a minute later, Durant's big hat fan flew the opponent directly. Durant's attack and defense destruction mode left the Bulls helpless in just over a minute. In the final quarter, Durant simply played in the last few minutes, and in the last two minutes and 50 seconds of the final quarter, he hit the key ball to completely lock in the victory, and the nets also won the bulls, continuing to maintain the momentum of second place in the East.
