May 12 news, Dallas lone Rangers boss Mark Kuban recently talked about the relationship between team stars Luca donchic and christaps polzingis, admitted that the relationship between the two Gemini stars is general, the two often dissatisfied with each other, occasionally "quarrel". Today, polzingis talked about Kuban's remarks in an interview. He seems to have some objection to the argument of "quarrel". He even claims that he doesn't know what Kuban means.

"On the pitch, they (Dong Qiqi and polzingis) are very good, it's not that they didn't quarrel, they did," Cuban said in an interview. Coach Carlisle is in charge of the game, everything can be solved on the court, but they are different people and like to do different things Kuban also compared the relationship between dongqiqi and polzingis with Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry. Kuban revealed that the two former champions are not good friends either. It took them a long time to do anything off the court together.

Obviously, polzingis has some objection to Kuban's remarks, "my teammates and I don't have any problems off the court, I get along well with them. I don't know what Cuban is talking about. I try to be professional, do what I have to do, and give everything to the team like a soldier on the field Said polzingis.

The lone ranger has invested a lot of energy in the combination of dongqiqi and polzingis, and the discussion about whether they get along well or not seems to have never disappeared. But now the most important thing is that polzingis can return to health. Polzingis has been on and off this season due to a knee injury. According to coach Carlisle, the team is optimistic that he can make a comeback against pelicans on May 13. So far this season, polzingis has played 40 games, averaging 20.2 points, 9.1 rebounds and 1.6 assists.
