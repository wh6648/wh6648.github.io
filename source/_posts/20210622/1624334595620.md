On June 22, the Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Seventh World War and were eliminated. The team's guard Ben Simmons was criticized for his poor performance and no desire to attack. Magic Johnson talked about Ben Simmons on the show today. He suggested that the 76ers should trade him. At the same time, he also thought that Ben Simmons needed a new environment.

"He (Ben Simmons) needs a new start, a new start. So it's time to trade him, which is good for both the 76ers and Ben Simmons. He needs a veteran to help them regain their confidence. At the same time, we should let him understand that if you play aggressively, it will make the team better Said Magic Johnson. There is no doubt that Ben Simmons still has a lot of potential to explore. Hopefully he can improve next season, whether it's in the 76ers or other teams.

In addition, Magic Johnson also talked about the New York Knicks. The legend of the Los Angeles Lakers has a high opinion of the Knicks, which is one of the smartest young teams in the NBA today. In the eyes of Magic Johnson, he firmly believes that the success of the Knicks last season will make the league's superstars want to play in New York.

"Superstars want to play here (in New York) now," Magic Johnson said. "I think it's because they made it, they made it to the playoffs. This city is full of energy because of the Knicks, right? I think today's players are going to say, "Hey, man, if I put myself in a line-up with Julius (Randall), Emmanuel quikly, Barrett and so on. Hey, man, we can do something special. '

When it comes to championships, Magic Johnson is quick to point out that this is still the main driver for most superstars. In any case, New York will always be one of the hottest destinations, and now they have the potential to win, which makes this team more attractive.

"If I put my talent with them, can we win the championship? He'll talk to another person and that's the start of the game. And Julius Randall, I think a lot of people will want to play with him. Because he really works very hard, and he's a United man, he's very tough and competitive. " Magic Johnson continued.
