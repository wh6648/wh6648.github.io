On June 22, Stephen curry became an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2021-22 season, but all signs suggest that he will renew his contract with the Golden State Warriors this summer.

Warriors boss Joe lakob talked about Curry's future with the warriors on Tim Kawakami's podcast of the Olympic¡° I really want curry to be with us all his career, and I think he thinks the same as us. I really have nothing to say about the progress. I can only say that everything is in progress, or that we have started the process, and there will be results this summer. "

If you are a warriors fan waiting anxiously, I can only say that you may need to wait until mid August¡° I think we'll look at the draft and the free agent market first. I think it makes sense to see where we are going and to know where the team is going Lakob continued.

"We want to be with Stephen (curry) for a long time. We love him and the fans love him. Curry is still very good obviously. We will try our best to keep him in the warriors and make him happy Lakob continued, "we are very, very lucky to have him and you should enjoy every minute."

Curry is eligible for a four-year contract extension that costs more than $200 million. In the warriors' last 21 games last season, curry averaged 37.1 points and 5.2 assists per game, with a shooting percentage of 49.2%.
