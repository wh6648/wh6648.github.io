On June 22, the lottery draw for the 2021 NBA draft will be held tomorrow, and the order of the top 14 in the 2021 NBA draft will be decided. Today, NBA officials also announced the draw representatives of each team.

Anthony Edwards will represent his team in the draw. As the number one pick in 2020 and the best rookie runner up of the year, Edwards averaged 19.3 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.1 steals for the Timberwolves. The chance of Timberwolves entering the top three is 27.6%.

The Houston Rockets, with the worst record in the league, have the highest chance of winning the top spot (14%) and entering the top four, along with the Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic. If the Rockets drop to fifth place in the draft - with a 47.9% chance of that happening - it will be sent to Oklahoma City as part of last year's trade of Chris Paul to thunder for Russell Westbrook. In order to avoid this, the Rockets hope to borrow the good fortune and history of Hakim Olajuwon, who will represent the team in the lottery. Olajuwan was the number one in the 1984 draft with historical significance, and also the last number one before the introduction of the lottery system. Olajuwan is also a symbol of the Rockets. He led the Rockets to the championship in 1994 and 1995 for two consecutive years.

Another legend who will attend the lucky draw is basketball legend swin cash. Swain Kesh has been in WNBA for 15 seasons. She has been selected as an all star four times and won the championship three times. After her retirement, she has appeared on live TV many times as a commentator. She is now vice president of basketball operations and team development for the New Orleans pelicans. Swain cash would like to see the pelicans finish in the top four (20.2%), a team that has made only one playoff since 2016.

The specific list is as follows:

Minnesota Timberwolves: Anthony Edwards (active player)

Detroit Pistons: Ben Wallace

Charlotte Hornets: miles bridges (active player)

Chicago Bull: mark eversley (General Manager)

Cleveland Cavaliers: Kobe Altman (General Manager)

Golden State Warrior: Rick WILTZ (president)

Oklahoma City Thunder: Naz Muhammad (general manager of G League)

Orlando Magic: Jeff Weltmann (president)

King of Sacramento: Mont McConnell (General Manager)

San Antonio Spurs: Peter Holt (boss)

Houston Rockets: Hakim Olajuwon
