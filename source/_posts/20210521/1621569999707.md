With 58 seconds left in the playoff playoff play off between the Lakers and the warriors, LeBron James took two steps away from the three-point line in 1.8 seconds to meet Stephen curry and hit the winning goal, helping the Lakers beat the warriors 103-100. According to Marc J. spears, a famous ESPN reporter, James has not fully recovered from his ankle injury.

"We need to worry about LeBron James. He should be a point guard. I hear he's playing with one leg Marc J. spears said.

This season, James missed a total of 26 games due to ankle injury (there was a rotation before the all star game), which led the Lakers to fall all the way from being expected to compete for the first place in the Western Conference to seventh place in the Western Conference, only playing in the playoffs to qualify. Although media reports said James' high ankle sprain will recover to nearly 100% at the beginning of the play off. But Lakers coach Vogel said in an interview that James still has some slight pain in his ankle, but he still insists on playing in the playoffs with an injury.
