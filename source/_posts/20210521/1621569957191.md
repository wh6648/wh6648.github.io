On May 21, yesterday, in the 7-8 playoff at the home of the Lakers, the Lakers relied on James' winning three-point victory over the warriors at the last minute to lock in the seventh place. And in the first three quarters of this game, the Lakers have been behind the warriors, the Lakers star Nongmei also revealed in an interview after the game, is the warriors garbage wake up the Lakers.

In the second quarter of last night's game, Jordan Poole hit a three-point goal, the warriors lead extended to 12 points, Vogel was forced to call a pause. Both teams headed for the bench, while warriors Anderson jumped over and hit James on the shoulder and said a few words to him. Not long ago, he broke through James on the right side of the switch attack and scored successfully.

In Anderson's eyes, there must have been some problems between him and James in the first half. But James didn't seem to realize it until he said a few hard words to James. After that interaction, James was obviously more energetic. This energy was transmitted to his teammates in the second half. They recovered the score and won the game in the second half.

After the game, thick eyebrow said that he didn't even realize the repeated contest between Anderson and James, but he was not surprised that James was angered by these things. Because earlier in the game, Poole did the same thing.

"You never want to provoke a bear," Davis said. "It's funny, and I told Poole. We were all called technical fouls. I hit the middle jump shot and told him, "you wake me up.". It's playoff basketball, and it happens all the time
