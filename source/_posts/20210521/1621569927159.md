On May 21, 2021, the NBA officially announced the shortlist of major awards in the regular season. The editors of Sohu's NBA editorial department also selected MVP, best defensive player, best coach, best sixth person, fastest-growing player, best rookie and best lineup, and decided the final award according to the number of votes.

1、 MVP: Nicolas Jokic (4:1)

Candidates: Nicolas Jokic, Joel enbid, Stephen curry

TTG: Nicolas Jokic

There should be no doubt that Jokic won the MVP. In the season when the League was attacked by injuries, Jokic still kept 72 games of full attendance. After Murray was injured, Mr. Yue led the Nuggets to adjust in time to keep in the top four position in the western region. Even at the last moment, Nuggets surpassed the clippers and rose to the third place in the western region. This season, Jokic has 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.3 assists.

Dali: Steven curry

Although he is still a schoolboy, curry is more and more mature. In adversity, curry also shows the style of team leader. Although the team's performance is not as good as the other two candidates, for the warriors, curry has contributed a lot.

Charon: Nikolay Jokic

After Murray, one of the core players, was seriously injured and absent, the Nuggets did not recover. On the contrary, they gained a firm foothold in the western region and achieved the top performance. All this is due to the leadership of Jokic, who is more important than the other two players in supporting the team. The Nuggets are a real threat in the West.

#9: Nikolay Jokic

There are three conditions to meet the MVP in my mind: 1. Impeccable personal performance in the whole season; 2. Help the team to become better; 3. Storytelling. In terms of personal performance, it's hard to distinguish between enbid, Jokic and curry. However, the injury of enbid and the strength of the 76ers were slightly reduced in my score; Curry had an epic season, but the team's record was tough. So I voted for joachi, who led the Nuggets to third place in the West and averaged three doubles per game. More importantly, in this extremely special season, Nuggets suffered a large number of injuries, and after losing weight, Jokic played 72 games, which is commendable. Personal performance, contribution to the team and storytelling meet all my requirements for MVP.

Lao Wu: Nicolas Jokic

He averaged 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds and 8.3 assists in 72 games, bringing nuggets to the third place in the competitive western region. Curry's regular season record was a drag, while enbid played 21 fewer games than Jo.

2、 Best defensive player: Rudy gobel

Candidates: Rudy Gerber, Ben Simmons, Drummond green

TTG: Rudy Gerber

The Jazz are number one in the league, and Gerber's role is very important. This two time DPOY winner, let Jazz's defense also in the League first position. This season, Gerber averaged 2.7 blocks and 13.5 rebounds per game, ranking second in the league. He is the best defender to protect the basket.

Dali: Rudy gobel

The Jazz's record is the best illustration. Gerber has also been deprived of the title of blocking king. The best defensive player is the praise for his performance in one season. If you look at Gerber's performance and jazz's record, what can you say about the best defender.

Charon: Rudy gobel

The Jazz's record of ranking first in the western region this season has been attributed to Gabriel as an inside player. Having won the best defensive player award twice, Gerber has made no less contribution in the defensive end this season, leading the jazz to the position of the first defensive team in the NBA. In Gerber's playing time, the Jazz's defensive efficiency can be improved by 12.1 points every 100 rounds; Gobel can limit his opponent's shooting percentage to 14.4% lower than the average. He is the best defender of the season.

#9: Rudy Gerber

The regular season champion Jazz plays the offensive firepower of the top three in the league, three points, conversion and counterattack. Behind these is the defensive efficiency of the top three in the league. Gerber is the pillar of the whole Jazz defense system. This season, he is seventh in the league in defensive efficiency (third in the League after putting aside those players who hardly play), second in net efficiency, and 12th in game contribution value. DPOY deserves to be absent for only one game this season.

Lao Wu: Rudy gobel

At the beginning of the season, who would have thought that the Jazz won the first place in the league, Gabriel played an important role in guarding the basket. Although the MVP level players, such as Yoshio Yoshio and enbid, were not so good, he used 13.6 rebounds, 0.6 steals and 2.7 blocks to guard the Jazz penalty area.

3、 Best Coach: Tom sybodou (3:2)

Candidates: Monty Williams, Tom sybodou, Quinn Schneider

TTG: Monty Williams

In the recent NBA Coach Association Coach of the year, sun coach Monty was elected. This year, Monty led the Suns to return to the playoffs after 11 years. Monty deserves this award.

Dali: Tom sybodou

The New York Knicks' salted fish turn over is a bit unexpected. There is no big change in the player configuration. The growth of young players and the training of coach thibodou are the main reasons.

Caron: Monty Williams

Last season in the bubble Park, Monty Williams coaching the Suns had achieved 8-0 record, but because of the previous dig too big, missed the playoffs. This season, the momentum of the Suns has been extended. With the joining of Chris Paul, the Suns have become the second seed in the West from the Lotto area team, which is inseparable from Monty Williams' coaching philosophy and team culture.

#9: Tom sybodou

For many years, the Knicks team, with almost no big change in the lineup and lack of superstars, has become the fourth in the East this season. It's hard not to credit the coach for such a long-span promotion. Thibodou infused the Knicks with the iron and steel that a champion team should have, making them one of the best defensive teams in the league. Although they are unable to compete for the championship for the time being, young people like Randall, Barrett and Noel, with the help of siburdu, are gradually shaping the correct basketball concept and winning habits. This influence is very far-reaching.

Lao Wu: Tom sybodou

Mud can also be supported on the wall, sibodu created a miracle. Can you imagine that the Knicks are better than the Hawks, heat and Celtic? He is the NBA version of Yanis, although the upper limit is not much high, but can guarantee the lower limit of the team.

4、 Best sixth man: Jordan Clarkson (3:2)

Candidates: Jordan Clarkson, Joe ingers, Derek Ross

TTG: Jordan Clarkson

This season the Jazz League first secret is not only defense, three-point firepower is also a very important reason. Clarkson, who has averaged 18.4 points and 3.1 three points this season, is the second point of fire in the jazz. At the same time, Clarkson let the Jazz main rotation of the transition period of attack has greatly improved, after Mitchell was injured, he took up the burden of attack and organization.

Dali: Derek Ross

Old rose is a more and more likable player, even the older the appearance is, the more interesting it is. The transfer to the Knicks in the middle of the season has brought a very positive change to the team. In the end, the Knicks also entered the playoffs, and Ross got the chance to prove himself.

Charon: Jordan Clarkson

Although Clarkson's All-Star status has declined after the game and has been stalled recently, his 18.2-point average throughout the season still gives him an advantage in the competition for this award. Clarkson's real shooting rate before the All-Star game was as high as 58.1%. There was a highlight game in which he slashed 40 points wildly. As a substitute, Clarkson brought a very important firepower supplement to jazz. From all aspects, he was in line with the conditions of the best sixth man.

#9: Jordan Clarkson

There is no dispute.

Wu: Derek Ross

Although Clarkson's attack and Ingles's organization are impressive, before Ross's inspirational story, the Jazz duo seems to be a little vulnerable. The fans are not only watching the performance on the court, but also inspired by the sportsmanship.

5、 Rookie of the year: Anthony Edwards (3:2)

Candidates: lamello Bauer, Anthony Edwards, tyris Halliburton

TTG: Anthony Edwards

First of all, we have to mention that it's a pity that lamello Bauer was injured. Before he was injured, he was undoubtedly the best rookie candidate. Edwards secured the starting lineup of the Timberwolves in the second half of the season. He has played 72 games and started 55 games, averaging 19.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.

Dali: ramelo Bauer

Although the Hornets finally failed to enter the playoffs, but Bauer is still the most outstanding rookie performance, at least for the team's help is visible. In contrast, the top one's performance is a bit flat, which is also related to the team record of the Timberwolves.

Caron: Anthony Edwards

Although three goals seemed to be the best rookie in the first half of the season, his injury and the number of appearances affected his competitiveness. Top scorer Edwards rose in the second half of the season, averaging 19.3 points per game, shooting 46.9% in April and may. In rookie season, the only players who can reach this level are Zion, Dong Qiqi, treyan, Mitchell, enbid and Lillard.

#9: Ramelo Bauer

Although Edwards showed great competitiveness in the second half of the game, the best rookie in my mind is still three goals. From the bench to the steady start, the three goals were ready from the first moment of entering the league, and showed great stability throughout the season. Compared with Edwards' low drive and high drive, the three goals were more convincing. More importantly, he helped the Hornets, who were short of major general, into the play off.

Mr. Wu: Anthony Edwards

Three goals in rookie season has been amazing talent, but the absence of 21 games has become the biggest weakness. Edwards often hit less than 30% in the middle of the season, and broke out at the end of the season, becoming an efficient scorer. Edwards narrowly won the match between two big stars of tomorrow.

6、 Fastest growing player: Julius Randall (4:1)

Candidates: Julius Randall, Jeremy grant, Michael Porter

TTG: Julius Randall

In important awards, I always think that the improvement of the team's performance is a necessary factor. This season, Randall played a 24 + 10 average double data, and the Knicks to the eastern fourth position.

Dali: Julius Randall

Randall led the Knicks to return to the playoffs after an obvious performance, and as the leading star of the Knicks, Randall's progress is inseparable from the team's progress. He successfully led the Knicks to recover with his own performance.

Charon: Julius Randall

This season, Randall's way of playing has changed significantly. In addition to the high-efficiency interior scoring as in previous seasons, he began to make three-point backward, difficult jump shots, and greatly increased the frequency of passing. He got three doubles in many games. This is a rare evolution for Randall as an inside player. In addition, under the training of sibudu, Randall's defense, which has been criticized for many years, has also improved significantly. With the Knicks team entering the playoffs again after 9 years, Randall, as the core of the team, deserves the best progress.

#9: Julius Randall

Randall averaged 19.5 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists last season and 24.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, 6 assists this season. Although the data increase is not playing, you can intuitively feel from the game that Randall has completed the transformation from "brush" to team leader. This season, not only his personal performance has improved, but more importantly, as a leading star, he has also led the Knicks to complete the transformation.

Lao Wu: Jeremy grant

Last season, grant was the bodyguard with a knife next to his teacher. Under the condition of the same treatment, why did he choose Detroit, which is also a waste of energy on and off the court? It turned out that under the coat of a pure blue collar player, there was a heart of carry all over the court.
