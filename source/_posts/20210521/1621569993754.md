On May 21, the NBA officially released the final two minute referee report of the Lakers and warriors, which showed that there was no wrong or missed judgment in the last two minutes.

1: 1 minute 54 seconds, Raymond - Green knocked down Wesley Matthews whether to blow offensive foul. The referee reported that chasing dream green blocked Matthews' movement with his knee when he was picking and rolling. The latter was knocked down and had no problem in attacking and covering fouls. Therefore, the referee on duty should be punished correctly.

2: Kentavios - Cadwell - Pop assists LeBron - James hit the ultra long three points before whether to go. One minute and three seconds later, James passed the ball to pop who cut into the interior line. The latter staggered after catching the ball and then passed the ball back to James. James hit a super long three points. The referee report pointed out that after pop's empty cut to catch the ball, he took two steps and passed the ball to James, but the ball didn't go.

3: 2.1 seconds before the end of the game, curry tried the last shot. Did the Lakers foul curry. Referee reports show that before the warriors ball, pop had a short close defense of curry, but this defense did not reach the level of foul. In addition, after curry received the ball, Anthony Davis also had slight physical contact with curry. The warriors made mistakes and failed to make the last shot. The referee's report pointed out that this also did not constitute a foul.
