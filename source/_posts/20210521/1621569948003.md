May 21, the Blazers today for the first round of the playoffs against the warm-up training, team veteran Cameron - Anthony was interviewed.

Anthony has been in the League for many years, but before this season, he has never played against a team he played for at the beginning of his career in the playoffs. The Blazers will start the first round of the playoffs on Sunday against Anthony's old club, the Nuggets.

Talking about the opponent nuggets in this round, melon revealed that he didn't realize that he had never played nuggets in the playoffs before. Many things have changed since he played for nuggets.

"There are a lot of different things now, my mentality is different, my goals are different, we have to try to win." Anthony said, "so it's a different mindset. But deep down, I know Denver has always been a special place for me

As a 10th NBA all star player, Anthony is ready for another NBA championship. In his 18 years of career and 12 playoffs, that's something he hasn't got. Last season, the Blazers were eliminated 4-1 by the Lakers.

"That's where I should go. I should play in the playoffs. It's a sincere voice in my heart. If I can't play in the playoffs, it's a big problem for me He said.

Anthony was selected by the Nuggets third in the 2003 NBA draft. He played for the nuggets for seven seasons, helping the team to reach the 2008-09 Western Conference finals. In 2011, he was traded to the Knicks in New York, where he spent more than six years; After that, he also stayed in Oklahoma and Houston for a short time, but he was traded to the bulls in early 2019. Before he started playing, he was cut by the bulls.

After that, Anthony didn't play for almost a year, and in November 2019, he was signed by the Blazers. He immediately inspired the team's firepower, had a chemical reaction with his teammates, and also provided leadership as a veteran.

This season he came off the bench, averaging 13.4 points per game, leading the Blazers' second team. "What he's done for us for a year and a half is exactly what we need," said trailblazers manager Terry Scott. This year, his role on the bench is an important reason why we have achieved this result

The last time the Blazers played the Nuggets in the playoffs was in 2019, before Anthony joined. The Blazers won the Seventh World War and advanced to the Western Conference finals, but were swept out by the warriors in the Western Conference finals.

Similarly, after Anthony left nuggets, the staff who worked with him before also left. And the Nuggets are still very aware of the threat Anthony can bring.

"You can say that he is regarded as one of the greatest single scorers in the NBA. Anthony still maintains a high competitive level at this stage of his career, which is very impressive." Nuggets coach Malone commented.
