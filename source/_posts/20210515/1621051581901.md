On May 15, former Los Angeles Lakers star Lamar Odom recently got into trouble again. According to reports, his mother, Liza Morales, took him to court, saying that Odom had not paid the alimony for nearly a year.

Lisa Morales is Odom's childhood girlfriend. They have lived together for many years and raised two children. After Odom married Kardashian, the relationship between Lisa Morales and Odom deteriorated for a time, and there was a lawsuit for custody of their children. According to the report, Odom has to pay about $6000 a month for child support, college tuition and $9 million in insurance premiums. However, Odom was accused of failing to pay the money, leading Lisa Morales and her two children (both living together) to face eviction from the landlord. Morales also said that because Odom stopped paying tuition, her son was unable to attend a four-year university and had to turn to a community college. So Morales sued the Manhattan Supreme Court. According to court records, Morales is now unable to pay the rent. Since February 2020, she has owed more than $50000 in rent, which has now risen to $78000.

"Starting in June 2020, Lamar (Odom) stopped any support and just sent some money to his son sporadically, which put our son in a very difficult situation." Morales said in the lawsuit.

Odom has yet to respond to the lawsuit, with media reports saying Morales and Odom's Representatives "can't comment immediately.". It's worth mentioning that Odom has been promoting his performance match with former pop singer Allen Carter on twitter. Recently, he has also frequently appeared on camera to review his past, including interviews with Matt Barnes, Stephen Jackson and vladtv on podcasts.
