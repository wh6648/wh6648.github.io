It is reported on May 15 that the Brooklyn nets will play the Chicago Bulls at home tomorrow. Net coach Steve Nash said in an interview today that the three giants of the team - Kevin Durant, James Harden and Carey Owen - are expected to play against the bulls for the first time since they played against the warriors on February 13, And for the eighth time in the season.

"If everything remains the same, the three will play together tomorrow." Nash said in an interview after training today.

According to ESPN statistics, any combination of the three big nets has played 46 games for the team so far this season. Harden and Owen have played 19 games together, Durant and Owen have played 17 games together, and harden and Durant have only played three games together - including the win over the Spurs on Wednesday, which is harden's first game since April 5.

Coach Nash said he hoped another game would allow his scorers to have more chemistry before the playoffs. At the same time, Nash said that harden still has playing time limit, but it will not be as strict as playing in the game.

"It rarely happens. I don't need to have any expectations. I just want them to take the chance, let's get together, play together and feel what it's like to play together again." Nash said, "to be able to play together will have a positive impact on the team, it will be a very valuable experience, we must have such a mentality, we must continue to improve throughout the season."

Since Durant, Owen and harden joined forces in February, the lineup of the nets has also changed. Blake Griffin has been added to the team. He has become a key player on the bench of the nets, but he has not played with the big three.

"I'm glad they're playing together, and we're finally trying to create a rhythm that makes everyone healthy. Let's see what happens next. We have a long time to prepare for our opponents (playoffs). For those people, it's good. For us, when everyone is healthy, it's very good to look at our current situation. " Nets forward Jeff Green said.
