On May 15, reports from US media said that Laker coach Frank Vogel revealed in an interview that LeBron James participated in the team training today.

At 1 a.m. Sunday, the Lakers will be away against the Pacers. According to the latest injury report, James has a 50% chance to play¡° LeBron trained for the whole team today, but now we still have doubts about his appearance tomorrow, "Vogel said." we want to see how his body responds to today's training. "

"If all goes well, LeBron will hopefully be back on Sunday," Vogel continued. Before that, James did not return in the back-to-back game on Wednesday and Thursday.

"Thick eyebrow" didn't train today¡° He just trained one-on-one with the assistant, and he's likely to play tomorrow, "Vogel said.

The good news for the Lakers is that Dennis Schroeder has broken the health and safety agreement, but he didn't train today. Instead, he trained alone. The Lakers will assess Schroeder before tomorrow's game.

"Schroeder's situation is similar to that of thick eyebrow. He has done some simple exercises with the TA," Vogel said. "He has been released from isolation, so he is in good condition to play."
