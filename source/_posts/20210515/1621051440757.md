On May 15, Golden State Warriors star clay Thompson talked about the legendary Kobe Bryant in an interview with the Los Angeles Times today.

It's late. Clay Thompson has to go to school the next morning, but he still wants to hang out in the underground parking lot of Staples Center. Clay has a chance because his father, Michael Thompson, is a former Laker player and a member of their radio station. Of course, as far as clay is concerned, he doesn't care. He goes to the parking lot because Kobe always goes there after the game.

"My favorite part of the evening is to go to the parking lot and watch him (Kobe) leave. So I can say hello to him and see what car he drives, what clothes he wears and how he walks. For me, the nights in the Staples Center parking lot were wonderful memories. If he knows my name, I can show off to my friends that Kobe is my "good friend." Clay recalled in an interview.

Clay has now grown into a warrior superstar. When clay visited Staples Center as an NBA player for the first time, Kobe scored 39 points, and clay was finally able to defend his favorite player on the court. Clay has played more than 600 regular season games since then, but he still remembers the data that night.

"I'll never forget that night's statistics: I made 6 of 8 shots and scored 14 points. I hope Kobe can notice that I'm a good player." Said clay.

In 2014, the Lakers went to Oakland to fight the warriors, where clay scored 41 points¡° I can't believe it. Wow, I got 40 points in the game between the Lakers and my idol? It's incredible. I'm still looking at that bright spot to motivate myself. After the game, he came up and hugged me and I felt like it happened yesterday Clay said.

When asked by warriors reporter ROS gold onwude what Kobe said to him, clay said that his mind was blank and he couldn't remember¡° I was totally fascinated by the aura of the star, he gave me a lot of support. That was my real moment and I knew I was going to be a player in the league Clay said.

In addition, clay also talked about the experience of meeting Kobe in the preseason in China. At that time, clay worked out in the hotel gym late at night, and then someone patted him on the shoulder and looked up to see that it was Kobe.

"I was surprised. I said, "Oh, how are you, man?" Then he said, "hello." He just said so much and went to the gym£¨ I didn't expect him to come here on his own initiative. " Said clay.

The modern NBA is full of people who want to be a player like Kobe, or who are influenced by those who want to be a player like Kobe¡° To me, he was the greatest player of my time. He was Michael Jordan of my time. He did everything... I just think he was the leader of the time when I grew up watching football, especially as a Los Angeles man, he was our G.O.A.T Milwaukee Bucks guard Zhu huoledi said.

"Some people succeed for a reason," said Nate McMillan. "Kobe put a lot of effort into his skills and became the player he became. I saw it with my own eyes on the Olympic team

"You see the will he (Kobe) showed in the game, you can see it in some players today - Mamba spirit." Chris Middleton said.

As a competitor, to be respected by Kobe is the ultimate badge of honor for NBA stars who are still striving to become famous at the end of his career.
