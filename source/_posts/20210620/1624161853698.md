On June 20, the NBA playoffs continued, the eastern semi-final nets and bucks ushered in the seven wars, and finally lost 111-113 to bucks through overtime nets, which was eliminated by 3-4. Durant struggled throughout the game, shooting 17 of 36, scoring 48 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists.

In the current nets team, the only thing they can rely on is Durant. In this round of series, Durant has only one game less than 40 minutes, and even plays the whole game in the fifth game. As soon as the game came up, Durant showed his determination to win. In the Bucks' 6-0 start, Durant made a sudden stop and hit the middle shot. Then he made another three-point run, scoring five points in a row to help the nets open the attack and assist Harris to make three points.

Soon Tucker was in charge of the defense of Durant. Durant's attack became extremely difficult. He played two singles in a row, one was cut off, one was fouled, only two penalties and one hit. However, with Tucker off the field for huoledi main defense, Durant is much more relaxed, he used height advantage to complete the attack in the low position, two turn over jump shots hit, one assist Brown throw in.

Durant scored another three points in the second quarter, broke through Brown's dunk, and the defensive side also helped to fan Middleton's layup. After a brief downturn, Durant quickly adjusted back to face Tucker again. He finally gained the upper hand. First, he hit three difficult points against Tucker and Daluo, followed by a strong horse riding archery, a sudden stop and a pitching shot. Continuous scoring helped the basket net expand the difference to 10 points.

However, he soon fell back in the match with Tucker. In the last attack of the second quarter, he was cut off by the close defense. In the third quarter, he forced a three-point shot and failed to get the ball. When he received the ball, he was destroyed again. After the Bucks overtook the score, Durant made a sudden stop in the middle shot, hit two free throws, pulled out three points, and assisted Harris to make three points. Durant hit four free throws in a row. Driven by his continuous scoring, the nets regained the lead. Before the end of the third quarter, when the Bucks exceeded 3 points, Durant went to the basket to make a layup.

In the third quarter, although he was very difficult in the entanglement with Tucker, he still made 3-for-5 shots and scored 13 points with penalty, becoming the biggest contributor to the rebound. Durant's defense in the last quarter was more rigorous. In the first half of the quarter, he only made a quick stop and hit the middle shot. More often, he missed three points, made three breakthroughs, was blocked by Lopez twice, and was cut off by Middleton once.

At the most critical moment in the last quarter, Durant finally recovered his form. He received harden's long pass in the front court and made a 2 + 1 slam dunk, as well as two penalty shots of sudden kill. In the last two minutes, when the Bucks overtook him by three points, Durant made a sudden stop and shot again, followed by a sudden layup, scoring two goals in a row to help the nets regain the lead.

However, in the last minute, he was cut off by Tucker and Middleton in the process of breakthrough. When he was 4 points behind in the last 50 seconds, he couldn't make the shot in the face of Tucker's emergency stop. After that, Tucker's emergency stop in the singles finally hit, helping the net to catch up to 2 points. When the net was 2 points behind at the last moment, Durant held the ball to face Tucker's close entanglement. Durant pressed the ball to the last moment, turned around and stepped on the three-point line to press tucker to make a long-range shot, equalizing the score in the last second and dragging the game into extra time.

In extra time, Durant even had no chance to make a shot. He was chased in the last minute, and his usual breakthrough layup was blocked again by dallo. In the last 35 seconds, he didn't make a shot in the middle of a sudden stop. In the last moment, he made a desperate three-point turn and threw a three-point shot. The nets also lost the hope of winning in the end. Durant, who fought hard for the whole game, was exhausted at the last moment by the rotation of Tucker, Middleton and Holliday, and the loss of the nets was inevitable.
