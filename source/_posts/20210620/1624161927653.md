June 20 news, according to the famous reporter Zach Lowe and 76ers analyst spike Eskin in this week's "the Lowe post" discussed the Philadelphia team starting point guard Ben Simmons transaction value. Due to the lack of shooting and free throw ability in the playoffs, it may affect his utility and price in the NBA market. The general manager of several NBA teams said that their interest in Ben Simmons is not as high as before.

"I want to tell the fans in Philadelphia that the general managers of other teams are watching this year's playoffs very closely. In the past 48 hours, I have talked with some general managers who have been interested in Simmons. For me at least, it may be just a pose. They said, "well, we are not as interested in him as before." Zach Lowe revealed.

That's the level of players I think they can expect. He's going to make them a better team to attack and I think he's going to be very, very suitable for him. I think another action must be taken because I don't think he and Seth curry can start at the same time. In the series with the Hawks, Seth Curry's defense was completely torn. I know the 76ers fans will be disappointed because just a week ago they were talking about Lillard and now we're talking about CJ mccullam, but I think you have to think about that

This season's playoffs, Simmons's weakness has been exposed, projection, free throw ability is insufficient defects by the Hawks infinite amplification. Hawks frequently use "chopping Ben Simmons" tactics. In the sixth game of the series, coach rivers even replaced him directly.
