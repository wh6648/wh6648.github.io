On June 20, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Brooklyn nets at home ushered in the eastern semi-final with Milwaukee Bucks for seven. At the end of the game, the Bucks narrowly won the nets 115-111 in extra time, eliminated their opponents with a total score of 4-3, and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals.

Although, the nets regret to be eliminated, but this season, for the nets team, for the nets fans, it is a dreamlike, and ups and downs of the journey.

In fact, as early as last season, when Durant and Owen announced that they would join hands in Brooklyn, the focus of NBA territory gradually shifted from the west to the East and to New York City.

At the beginning of this season, when the nets made a big deal again and recruited James harden into the team, they signed Aldrich and Blake Griffin continuously through the base salary. The nets once had the most luxurious lineup of paper talent in the league, and the championship was so close to them.

It has to be said that the basketball stars really like to play for each other, and hardly spend much effort. As a coach, Nash has completed the integration of the team.

However, the subsequent series of changes, but gradually disrupted the deployment of the nets.

First, at the end of the regular season, Aldrich suddenly announced his retirement due to heart disease. Adelaide's departure made it possible for the team to make a new adjustment and let Durant play more inside.

Then, harden suffered from hamstring injury. Although he has been trying to recover, the effect after his forced comeback is not good. Until the playoffs, his hamstring injury recurred again. Although, in the most crucial match of the semi-final, when Owen was absent and harden insisted on coming back with injury, his physical condition was still far from the real perfect body.

There is also the old injury Owen, this season, he spent a lot of time in the regular season to recuperate. This kind of recuperation ensured Owen's outbreak in the playoffs. However, it is a pity that in the fourth game of the series with the Bucks, Owen was involved in the controversial foot incident. As the victim of the foot incident, he had no choice but to retire and bid farewell to this season.

Of course, the reason why the nets can still play 7 games with the bucks and keep the hope of promotion to the last minute is that they also have Kevin Durant.

In the series with bucks, when the scorers in the team fell one by one, Durant stood up and used his superhuman will and epic scoring ability to prop up the attack of the nets. He played the whole game twice. G7 plus extra time, he fought for 53 minutes and 7 games. He scored 48 + twice and opened the death mode several times. In his body, it seems that it is difficult for you to see the serious injury trace of Achilles tendon rupture two years ago. KD seems to be more energetic than himself in his 20s. He has regained his peak state, and his recovery can be called a medical miracle.

Unfortunately, Durant gave all he had, but fortune didn't care for him. With the nets out, the lineup they spent a lot of money to build also failed in the second championship.
