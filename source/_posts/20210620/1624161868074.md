On June 20, the NBA playoffs continued, the eastern semi-final nets and bucks ushered in the seven wars, and finally lost to bucks by 111-115 in overtime, so they were eliminated by 3-4. Harden continued to be in the doldrums, making 5 of 17 shots, only 2 of 12 three-point shots, 10 free throws, 22 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists.

Since the return of harden in this series, he has not found his offensive state. Maybe the injury has not fully recovered, which makes him dare not do enough action on the field. He can't break through the end, and he can't make full use of three points. The same is true in this game. He is very depressed in the game.

In the first quarter of the game, harden relied on a three-point foul and two breakthrough kill, using seven free throws to score, but in the sports war, harden had no gains, three shots to strike iron. In the second quarter, harden's personal attack still did not improve, but he continued to help the team in other aspects, such as assists, Griffin's three-point dash, behind the ground assists Brown's mid shot, and actively struggles to get the ball back.

When the two teams were close to the score, harden missed three points, but in the second attack, he easily scored by catching the ball under the basket, and then brown, who assisted in the air cutting, scored. But after the three points or not into the breakthrough to the basket was blocked by Daluo, but he took back the ball power, Huo ledi shot into 2 + 1, although this time harden both scoring and assists, but in the offensive end he is still very difficult. The whole first half was a dismal 2-for-9.

In the second half, harden's offensive state did not improve at all. Although he successively assisted Durant and Griffin to score three points, he sent out four assists in a single quarter. When the Bucks were 4 points ahead of the game, harden retreated to the letter brother and finally made another three points. Later, he made a breakthrough and made two penalties. However, after that, he missed three consecutive three points and was directly robbed by passing the ball to Durant.

At the end of the game, harden first broke through the throw and hit, but after a long time no performance, there were two pass errors. In the last four minutes, when the time was coming, harden made a steady hit against the difficult three-point defense, which helped the nets expand the difference to five points. This also became the most important and the last time he scored in the whole game. In extra time, harden did not grasp a three-point chance of a good vacancy.

With Durant missing the key ball in the last minute of extra time, the nets also lost the game, lost the whole series, and harden's performance in this game and this series was quite bad.
