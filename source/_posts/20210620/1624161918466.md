On June 20, the NBA playoffs continued. In the seventh game of life and death, the Milwaukee Bucks narrowly beat the Brooklyn nets 113-111 in extra time and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals 4-3. The team's two giants, Middleton and hollerdy, finally ended their slump in the fourth quarter. The two contributed 36 points, including 9 points in the fourth quarter, while winning the midfield with 40 seconds left in extra time was priceless.

Because Middleton had 38 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 5 steals in the sixth key campaign. In addition, huoledi also had 21 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals. As a result, the Bucks managed to drag the series into game 7.

There is no doubt that the key to the Bucks' victory is not only the leader, but also the other two core players, Middleton and hollerdy.

But from the first two quarters of the seventh game, Middleton and hollerdy's performance, the two play very bad. Middleton only had a 39 second break in the first half, but he only made 2 of 11 shots in the campaign. As for fullback geraldi, he played 20 minutes and was also 2-for-11.

The two giants feel cold at the same time, a total of 22 shots, only 4. What's worse, Middleton and hollerdy's three-point six shot all hit the iron, a total of only nine points into the account. It is because of the downturn of the two men that the bucks are always suppressed by the bucks in the first two quarters.

After half-time, Middleton's performance showed a slight sign of recovery. He only made 2 of 5 shots in the third quarter. However, the guard huoledi is four shots all hit iron, the most important thing is, huoledi actually break the layup is not.

In fact, huoledi feel bad, a large part of the reason comes from the defensive end to mark Durant consumption. Because of the dislocation of the top defense "death", huoledi is obviously exhausted, huge height and weight gap, huoledi can only use fouls to stop Durant.

The fourth quarter just started 2 minutes, huoledi received the fourth personal foul, he was also very depressed after being replaced. After hollerdy left, Middleton finally came back to life. In the first five minutes, Middleton shot in a row in the middle distance. He made three of five shots and contributed six of the team's 10 points.

After his comeback, hollerdy finally hit his first three-point shot in his sixth three-point shot. But then on the defensive end, he immediately lost his fifth foul on Durant. Fortunately, after huoledi did not foul, the hundred million yuan gentleman in three points, the last quarter contributed nine points, the Bucks into overtime.

In extra time, Middleton hit a two-point shot against the super with 40 seconds left, which was also the key to winning the game for bucks. In the end, the Bucks advanced to the Eastern Conference finals, while Middleton had 23 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals, and hollerdy had 13 points.
