On June 20, the NBA playoffs continued. In the seventh game of life and death, the Milwaukee Bucks narrowly beat the Brooklyn nets 113-111 in extra time and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals 4-3. The letter brother really spell out all the bullets, contributed 40 points, 13 rebounds and 5 assists, but he is always criticized for the free throw or his key short board.

Fight for seven, win or go home?

As the leader of bucks, he set the tone for himself and the whole team from the beginning. The all star made a splash in the first quarter. He played 11 minutes and 18 seconds, only 42 seconds off. He made 4 of 5 shots and hit a 3-pointer, scoring 10 points in a single quarter. His fierce attack also caused Bruce Brown to receive a technical foul in a defense.

However, the accident occurred in the second quarter of 8 minutes 28 seconds. At that time, the Bucks attack, letter brother did not participate in the Bucks attack, but stayed in the Bucks backcourt, and then the game was forced to suspend. Originally, the letter brother attack slowly to the front court, but suddenly slowed down, and then went directly to the bench.

However, in the next minute of rest, the letter elder brother did not return to the dressing room. A minute later, the letter elder brother appeared again. After all, the Bucks have always been suppressed by the nets. If the letter elder brother continues to rest, the suspense of winning or losing the game will be completely lost.

A dribble break, letter brother was robbed by harden. After the jump with harden, the height of the dominant letter brother actually did not get the right to the ball. Obviously, there seems to be something wrong with my body. The even worse signal is that the letter brother is standing on the free throw line, and all the net fans count down his free throw time. Under the heavy pressure, the letter brother's first penalty is three, and the second penalty is partial.

In short, the second quarter of the letter brother is still playing 11 minutes, but he is puzzling sudden downturn, sports war 4 shot 1, free throw 6 free throw 3, only 5 points into the account. Because of his "second quarter of fans", the Bucks also fell 47-53.

After half-time, the letter brother is obviously full of blood resurrection state. In the first seven minutes of the third quarter, he made four of six shots and scored 11 points. Durant just hit a three-point, then the letter brother immediately in the offensive end with answer ball response. The most important thing is that the letter brother's crazy score helped the bucks to achieve anti super.

With 9.2 seconds left in the third quarter, the letter of the line received the pass and slammed the basket with his left hand. He scored 15 points in a single quarter and more than 30 points in three quarters. The letter brother led the bucks to surpass. Entering the fourth quarter, the letter brother's free throw once again became the focus, he once again appeared the embarrassment of three non touch. With two minutes and 45 seconds left from the end of the game, he once again faced the chance to play three points, but he still failed to hit the free throw.

Due to the physical decline of the letter brother, and Middleton and hollerdy feel back, so the last five minutes, the letter brother will be too much ball right to the two teammates. In the last shot of the last second, the two teams were forced to enter the extra time.

After Griffin's sixth foul, he scored against Durant's defensive hook. These two points helped the bucks to reverse their decline. The most important thing is that the letter brother's rebound ensured the Bucks' final promotion to the Eastern Conference finals.
