The Los Angeles Lakers have slipped to seventh place in the Western Conference after losing to the Portland Trail Blazers. Isaiah Thomas immediately updated his personal social media to introduce himself to the Lakers, saying that he can help them out of the current predicament.

"Brothers, I can help the lads of the Lakers during this time!!" Isaiah Thomas wrote on personal social media.

If the current situation continues, the Lakers need to go through the playoffs to get playoff tickets. Team coach Frank Vogel said in an interview that he is still very confident in the play off, no matter who he meets, he can win.

"We will try our best to continue to compete and win more games. No matter where we are in the first place, we are confident. We have five games left and we will continue to work hard to win as many games as possible Vogel said.

In the last 10 days, the Lakers will face the Suns, the Knicks, the Rockets, the Pacers and the pelicans. There is no doubt that the Suns will be a big challenge for the Lakers. They are trying their best to compete for the number one seed position in the West. The Knicks are also a hard nut to crack. They not only have Julius Randall, but also RJ Barrett and Derek Ross. Anyway, the Lakers need help, and Isaiah Thomas will be a good choice.

Isaiah Thomas has played 528 games in his career so far, including 361 starts, 18.1 points, 2.4 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game, with a shooting percentage of 43.5%, a three-point percentage of 36.3% and a free throw percentage of 87.2%. During the 2019-20 season of the COVID-19 pandemic, Isaiah Thomas fought 40 matches for the Washington Wizards, contributing 12.2 points and shooting 40.8%. In mid April, he signed a 10 day short contract with the pelicans, scoring 10, 11 and 2 points in three games.
