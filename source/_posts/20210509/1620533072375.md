In an interview with Jorge sedano recently, former NBA player Jay Ross shared a story about Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard.

Kobe and Howard's partnership with the Los Angeles Lakers started with a fairy tale, but soon turned into a horror movie. There is no doubt that the Los Angeles Lakers created one of the worst big three in NBA history, which was swept by the Spurs in the first round of the 2013 playoffs. All this is a disaster, except for Kobe, no one foresaw its coming. In a recent interview with Jorge sedano, former NBA player Jay Ross said that Kobe had known before he saw Howard that working with him would not produce ideal results.

"When he (Kobe) called Dwight Howard for the first time, I was standing next to him in his basketball camp. I'm going to say that now because they've reconciled. I have never said that before. When he got a call from Dwight Howard, I heard a conversation between them. Dwight Howard was very excited. He asked Kobe about Los Angeles, about how he would help himself to be better, and about his off court situation. He asked a lot of things. After a lot of questions, do you know what Kobe said¡ª¡ª What I'm going to tell you is how to win the championship. What do you think? " Jay Ross revealed in the program.

"He (Kobe) and Dwight Howard said after the phone call:" his mind is not in the right place, it doesn't work. " And then, they really didn't succeed. " Jay Ross said.

We never know what Kobe heard or felt on the phone with Howard, what made him realize that the big man was not ready for the challenge, but time has proved him right.
