Adrian wojnarowsk said New Orleans pelican's ronzo Bauer and Los Angeles Lakers' Dennis Schroeder were two potential targets.

"The point guard is very important to them [the Bulls]. The pelicans' ronzo Bauer and the Lakers' Dennis Schroeder are two potential targets. In addition, among other unrestricted free agents, Michael Conley, Kyle Lowry, TJ McConnell and Patty mills will also be considered Adrian wojnarowsk said on "NBA countdown.".

According to reports, the Bulls may enter the free agent market with about $24 million in salary space, which is enough for them to find some targets in the free agent market.

Bauer and Schroeder can provide backcourt depth for Zac raven, Kobe white and rookie Devon Dotson.
