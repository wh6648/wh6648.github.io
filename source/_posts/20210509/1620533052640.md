On May 9, the Los Angeles Lakers made another key mistake against the Portland Trail Blazers, slipping to seventh place in the Western Conference and facing the prospect of a playoff playoff playoff. ESPN famous commentator Stephen - A - Smith talked about the situation of the Lakers in the program.

"I'm scared now. I'm worried about the Lakers. I want the basketball world to officially realize that I don't even know if they can make it out of the playoff playoffs. I don't even know if the Lakers can win the playoffs. They don't look good. They don't look good at all A-smith said.

If the regular season is over, the Lakers will compete with the warriors for seventh place in the playoffs. It is worth mentioning that in the previous game, the Lakers were not ideal in defending Stephen curry, especially when the latter played the best basketball of his career since the MVP season. According to a-smith, Frank Vogel's team is facing problems that have been marginalized by the injuries of LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

"From this point of view alone, I'm very worried about the Lakers. Look at the other teams in the West... Suns, jazz, Nuggets, clippers, lone Rangers, you can't ignore the Blazers, you have every reason to worry about the Lakers. Now, I have entered a state of panic, the Lakers may not really win the playoff A-smith said.

"I don't think it's a good chance for the Lakers to beat these teams (the Blazers, the warriors and even the pelicans) in the playoff," said Buckley, a member of TNT's commentary team

NBA star Jay Ross said: "if the Lakers are reduced to play off, they will not be able to win the championship this season."
