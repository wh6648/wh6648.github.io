April 5 news, reports from the U.S. media said that today's nets lost 107-115 to the bulls, the end of a four game winning streak. In the absence of James Harden and Kevin Durant, Nets coach Steve Nash is not satisfied with the performance of the nets.

"We didn't play the rhythm we wanted tonight," Nash said. "I think we have to be more active on the defensive side."

Nash made a change, let LaMarcus Aldrich and Blake Griffin two new players start at the same time. From the process and results of the game, the two former all stars did not have a good chemical reaction.

The whole game, the nets in the interior of the offensive and defensive team is very slow. Nash made it clear after the game that he didn't like the combination of Adelaide and Griffin.

"Although the sample size is very small, only played 1-2 games, but I have to admit, I really don't like their (Adelaide and Griffin) interior combination," Nash said, "this may not be the future development direction of the nets, I will not row out such a lineup in the future."

Data show that the positive and negative value of Adelaide in this battle is - 12, Griffin - 10.

On Tuesday, the nets will play back-to-back Game 2 against the Knicks. Will Adelaide be absent because of injury management? In response, Nash said: "let's see tomorrow."

Taylor Johnson left early today due to injury. Nash said: "there is no latest news at the moment. Taylor (Johnson) will scan his knee tomorrow. Now the only thing we can do is wait for the scan result and hope it is not so bad. "
