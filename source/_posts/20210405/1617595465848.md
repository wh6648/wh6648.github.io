On April 5, it was reported that Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen curry, together with the Bruce Lee Foundation, will launch a customized sneaker, and the proceeds from the auction will be used to fund eight Asian American families who were victims of the Atlanta shooting. Curry has also become one of the few superstars in the NBA to make people aware that Asian Americans are experiencing harm.

According to previous reports, eight people were killed in the Atlanta shooting in March this year, including six Asian women. After that, curry and the relevant person in charge of the brand cooperated with the Bruce Lee Foundation to launch a customized pair of shoes. This pair of shoes are hand-painted in yellow and black color. On the side of one shoe is an illustration of Bruce Lee's family. On the other shoe is a picture of Bruce Lee. There is a famous saying of curry's favorite Bruce Lee: "under heaven, everyone belongs to the same family.". The shoes are designed to express support for the victims and their families of the Atlanta shooting in March last year. The custom shoes will be sold in the next few weeks and the proceeds will be distributed to the families of eight shooting victims.

"Disgust, fear and anger at the constant violence in our country," curry told the undefeated. "After what happened in the past year, not to mention in the history of our country, people are still working on unnecessary tragedies and worrying about their lives. We have to do better."

"He (Bruce Lee) urged himself to become a greater person than he imagined, and influenced the world in this way. I hope to pay tribute to Bruce Lee and his great influence in this way, but at the same time, I also hope that we can all unite. No matter where you come from, we still need to do a lot of things. It's going to take all of us to make it happen, to spread love and happiness, and to be positive. " Curry continued.
