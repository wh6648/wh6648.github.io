It was reported on April 5 that the nets lost to the Bulls today, ending their 4-game winning streak. Kevin Durant and James Harden continue to be absent due to injuries, which makes Carey Owen, another giant of the nets, feel helpless.

Owen did his best today. He made 12 of 27 shots in 38 minutes and handed over 24 points, 2 rebounds, 15 assists and 2 steals. It's worth mentioning that this kind of data is completed without one three-point (4-for-0) and one free throw.

15 assists set a new record for Owen in a single game of the season. The feeling of today's game brought Owen back to last season -- 19-20 season. At that time, KD was in the recovery period of Achilles tendon injury, and harden was still in the Rockets team, so Owen carried the nets on his shoulder alone. Since the arrival of "big beard", Owen's burden has been lightened, especially in attack organization.

This is the third time that the European team has sent 10 + assists in a single game of the season, while the nets have only won 1-2 in these three games. It is obvious from the game that Owen is the only star player of the nets, so he is taken care of by the bulls. In this context, Owen sent a series of wonderful passes to help the nets open up the situation. But it must be admitted that the nets team is not in the state and the shooting percentage is not satisfactory.

There is a data that is somewhat embarrassing, that is, Owen has 2 consecutive games with 0 free throws. This is the first time that Owen didn't get on the free throw line for two consecutive games in the European season, which shows that Owen didn't rush himself up.

On the other hand, the pace of attack and defense of the nets is very slow today. Is it because of the big man problem? In response, Owen said: "I will leave it to us to discuss."
