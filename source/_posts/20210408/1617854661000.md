Before the game, Nets coach Steve Nash talked about James Harden's injury and Kevin Durant's playing time after his comeback in an interview.

Harden was injured in the previous game with the Knicks team. According to yesterday's report, after MRI examination, the result showed that harden suffered a right hamstring strain. Speaking of harden's injury, coach Nash said: "harden did not find any problem in the first examination, but after the second scan, we found that the problem was more serious than the initial stage, and his hamstring strain was grade 1."

So far this season, harden has played 34 games for the nets, averaging 25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 11 assists. Due to the recent absence of harden, Carey Ou has become the main controller of the team. He has sent 42 assists in the past four games. The good news for the nets is that Kevin Durant is back in today's game against the pelicans. Durant has missed the last 23 games because of a hamstring injury.

Speaking of Durant, Nash said: "Durant's physical reaction is very good after several days of high-intensity training, so we think he can return, but we will pay special attention to his playing time. We will not let him return to play 35 minutes. The main purpose is to let him re integrate into the team and the game."

In addition, Nash also talked about Pelican star Zion Williamson, "he has a 'historical level' talent." Nash said.
