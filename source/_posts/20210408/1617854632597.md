Owen returned to first place in the East with 40 + in the last game. After harden's injury, Owen will play harden's role at the back. On April 8, 2021, the Nets beat the pelicans 139-111. Owen scored the team's highest 24 points and six assists, hitting four three-point shots.

Owen made a foul from James Johnson in the beginning, and a breakthrough through the ground directly threw away the opponent. Owen in recent games still have a strong output, full of offensive firepower. After harden's injury, Owen did take on more organizational tasks. In the first five minutes, Owen made a move after a quick drop. One person attracted two people's bags, and looked back to the moon to assist Harris, who followed him.

It should be said that Owen's assists are coming into a blowout after entering April. He has exceeded or reached 12 times in two games. In the first quarter of 4:50, Owen staged a rare scene in his career. After breaking through the bottom line, he faced the pelican's defensive center. Everyone thought he would pull or pass the ball. As a result, Owen went against the current and slammed the ball with both hands. This ball may be one of the rarest dunks in Owen's career.

In the first quarter, Owen was still efficient, with 9 points, 2 rebounds and 3 assists. He also had a three-point chase and one man played the rhythm. After coming back in the second quarter, Owen hit three points again. In fact, the average of 2.8 three points per game in the European season has equalled the highest in his career. In the last minute of the second quarter, it was Owen who made another three-point shot in the middle of the March. Owen's three-point shot was four in the whole half.

In the third quarter, Owen played a standard, very Iverson style dribble in the bottom corner. After a trial step, he quickly backed back and pulled back. Facing the two men's defense, he quickly stopped and made a jump shot. There was no solution to the attack. Although this game is Durant's comeback, Owen is still the best player in the whole game. The ever-changing offensive end finally made the nets win in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter completely turned into garbage time. Owen's win-win value of + 29 was also the best. Finally, the Nets beat the pelicans for 2 consecutive wins.
