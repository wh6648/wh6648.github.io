The first one to break the deadlock was still the Hornets with better strength. Graham and McDaniels made an 8-0 start. Seeing that the attack could not be opened completely, the thunder called two pauses, and finally began to improve at the offensive end. Pokushevsky made three-point and four shot from the outside line, and mahledong also began to hit the middle range shot, and the two digit difference was quickly reduced to two points.

Werner meek and bridges scored another three points, and the difference was as much as 17 points.
