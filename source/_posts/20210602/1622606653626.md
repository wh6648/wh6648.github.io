On June 2, the NBA playoffs continued. The East's 3-1 leading nets continued to play at home against Celtic in the first round. In the end, the Nets beat Celtic 123-109, and Celtic were eliminated by 1-4. Tatum suffered severe defense in this game, shooting 14 of 27, scoring 32 points, 9 rebounds and 5 assists.

Tatum has become the only hope of Celtic at present. He has also shown his super attack power in this round of series. He has scored 50 and 40 points in the past two games, which also makes the nets defend him with great strength. At the beginning of the game, the nets played Tatum as one main defense, and the other was always ready to assist in defense. Sometimes, Tatum would pinch to force him out of the ball. At the defensive end, Tatum also needed to defend Durant for a lot of time, which made him very difficult at both ends of attack and defense. At the beginning of the game, Tatum also touched his right knee wrapped in thick knee pads, Obviously there are still injuries in the leg.

Tatum, who only hit one goal in the first three shots, was obviously very uncomfortable. He was forced to pass the ball in the face of the cooperative defense two times later. After facing Durant's close defense, he raced forward and pulled three points. Tatum started a wave of continuous iron strike. He failed to score three points twice, and failed to break through the encirclement once. Fortunately, he made a turn jump shot in the restricted area, Helping the team also helped to relieve the pressure. After 3-in-8 in the first quarter, Tatum's attack chances in the second quarter became less.

In the second quarter, he failed to score three points at a time and fouled Durant in the breakthrough. Although he made a forced breakthrough layup with one shot and made a strong attack on Durant, he made two free throws, but he failed to score three points at the whistle before the end of the half-time. The performance of 4 in 13 in the first half obviously could not help the team to take the lead.

In the second half, Tatum hit the iron with two three points and failed to make one turn jump shot. During a pause, Tatum's team doctor massaged his left foot when he was off the court, as if there was something wrong with his foot. However, at this stage of the game, it is obvious that he won't leave because of minor injury and illness. After that, Tatum started a wave of chasing points. First, he assisted Parker in the middle shot, followed by defense, and finally made another three points. Then, he made a strong back attack layup to help Celtic catch up to 7 points.

But soon he encountered another fierce attack, first in the singles Durant was blocked by three people was robbed, and then in the baseline breakthrough encountered another attack, passing mistakes. Before the end of the third quarter, Tatum first hit two free throws with strong sudden kill, and then hit a long-range shot after facing Durant's change of direction, helping Celtic catch up to 7 points and continue to bite the score.

At the end of the game, Tatum was replaced to rest for less than a minute, and was recalled as soon as he came up. He made another three points and another breakthrough throw to help Celtic catch up with 10 points again. Tatum didn't give up when he opened the net fire to 21 points. He first broke through the throw and then raced for three points, but the opponent's fire was fierce and his two fists were hard to beat four hands, and Tatum couldn't get back to the sky with another 30 +.
