On June 2, NBA reporter Dave mcmennamin said in a podcast that he got the tip that the management of the Lakers thought Andre Drummond was part of the team's future plan.

As soon as this year's trading deadline is over, "Zhuang Shen" and the Cavaliers have reached a buyout and resumed their freedom. After that, he decided to join the Lakers. It is worth mentioning that after wearing the purple and gold robe, Zhuangshen got a lot of opportunities in the late regular season because LeBron James and Anthony Davis were injured at that time.

But the problem is, Zhuang Shen and thick eyebrow partner did not produce too good effect. This year's playoffs against De Andre - Aton, Zhuang Shen also did not have any advantage to speak of.

"The Lakers have always let Zhuang Shen play as a formal starter, but he gets more playing time than this," mcmanamin said. "It can be seen that starting and playing time are very important to Zhuang Shen, as well as to the management of the Lakers."

"Because the management of the Lakers have shown that signing Johnson is not just for this half season," mcmanamin continued. "They see Johnson as part of their future plans."

Now the situation is, once thick eyebrow due to groin injury absence, Zhuang Shen will play a more important role in the interior. At the same time, he also has the opportunity to get the Laker's contract extension in the off-season of this year.

In the first four playoffs this year, Zhuang Shen averaged 20.5 minutes, 9.5 points and 10.5 rebounds.
