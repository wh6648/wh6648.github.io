June 3 news, reports from the U.S. media said that the Hawks center Clint Kapela's words, triggered the Nix team's two main players Derek Ross and Julius Randall's dissatisfaction.

What did Capella say? The Hawks are 3-1 ahead of the Knicks. According to the schedule, the G5 series will start on Thursday at Madison Square Garden.

"I feel the Knicks want to be tough, but it doesn't work," Capella said. "They want to talk rubbish to us, and of course we will respond. We can play tough, but we can also win. We're going to the Knicks' home now to win the game and send them on holiday

What's Rose's response to this¡° I'm 32 years old, but I've never said rubbish, "Rose said," so I'm less likely to say it because of Capella. Obviously, I'm too old to talk rubbish... "

Randall's attitude is, "why should I care what Capella says? This year we have not been optimistic, the odds also think that we have been out. However, the present situation is very comfortable for us. "

"So we will fight to the end!" Randall continued.
