On June 2, ramakus Aldrich found peace with his family after his sudden retirement in mid April due to a heart attack. One and a half months after he was forced to retire, Aldrich gave an exclusive interview with the Olympic, talking about the situation when he retired and his life after retirement.

"I've always been depressed. I'm trying to convince myself not to compete and learn not to be depressed. I still love basketball. Even now, I'm still trying to find myself. When you do something you love for a long time and lose it overnight, it's shocking. Although I knew it was the right decision, I talked with my family, my agent and the nets team over and over again, and they supported me absolutely no matter what Aldrich said.

"I'm definitely not ready to give up. I still think I have a lot to give the team and I have a lot to give the nets. I think they need what I bring them, so it's really hard to leave. They need an inside scorer and a basket keeper, and that's what I can do. I've been dealing with WPW all my life, a heart attack. I found out in 2006, the first year of my career. In the past few years, I've had a relapse, we've done research, and the doctors have done some research to make sure that nothing has changed. The game against the Lakers was very strange, my heart beat was strange, there was no rhythm, there was no energy. My heart beat irregularly throughout the game, which I had never experienced before. I don't know what happened. To be honest, I had a terrible night... At two or three o'clock in the morning, my heart was beating very hard, and then my condition became very bad. From 2 a.m. to 5 a.m., I was trying to breathe, and then around 5:30, I texted the team doctor, and then I went to the hospital. It was probably the scariest night in history. " Aldrich said.

Speaking about the decision to inform his teammates to retire, Aldrich said: "it's hard, man. I contacted Kevin (Durant) for the first time. I want to give him such respect because he was the first one to contact me after I bought out the contract. So I want to be the first to contact him. I think he was more shocked at first because he didn't believe or understand what I meant. Then we had another chat. I think these people are very excited about my joining. I wasn't too emotional on the phone, but then I started to get emotional. Every time you say "Hey, I'm retired," I'm definitely excited when it just happens. I'm still trying to make myself happy. I must be very depressed. I've been trying to recover from depression because the whole thing is so dramatic that I don't know how to find myself again. I also talked to James (harden) and he wanted to know what happened. I said, "do you remember that I said I couldn't find my state all the time?" He said, "I thought you said that feeling.". I said no, it's my heart. He said, "man, I don't know that yet." They all saw signs of something wrong, but they didn't know what it was. So I explained to them why I said that, and they now understand and let them try to understand what happened to me from playing to retiring

"I didn't choose Brooklyn because I wanted to go there and build a super team, I chose them because I could provide what they needed. I know everyone will say it's always a super team and I choose them because it's an opportunity for me to do what I can without having to adjust or change anything£¨ It's the hardest part. I have a chance to get to the finals, to go on that stage, to be a part of history, to leave my mark. I've been to the Western Conference finals, but I've never played in the finals. So this is an opportunity for me to go further and to add luster to my resume. I'm always proud to embrace every opportunity, to grow and learn from it. I want to experience the finals, to help these guys win and be part of this journey. If we do, hopefully we can do it two or three more times, so that's definitely the hardest part Aldrich said.
