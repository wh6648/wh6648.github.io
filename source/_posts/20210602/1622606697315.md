According to reports from the US media on June 2, in an interview today, Nuggets star Nicolas Jokic said he hopes to spend his whole career in Denver.

At the 2014 draft conference, the Nuggets selected Jokic in the 41st place in the second round. This season is his sixth year in the Nuggets, and he has a good chance to win the regular season MVP this year.

"When I came to Denver, I wanted to be Tim Duncan here," Jokic said. "He played in San Antonio all his career. If I can, I also hope to play in Denver for my whole career

With two years left on his current contract, Jokic will become a full free agent in the summer of 2023. If Jokic gets the MVP this year, according to the labor agreement, he will be eligible to renew his contract with the Nuggets in the coming summer, and then he will get a five-year top salary with a total value of $245 million.

Starting from the 2023-24 season, the salaries in these five years are US $41.72 million, US $45.05 million, US $48.66 million, US $52.55 million and US $56.76 million respectively.

Nuggets coach Mike Malone is very appreciative of Jokic, he said: "when Nikolay (Jokic) has a cool head, he is the best player in the NBA, we need this player."

In the first four games of the first round of this year's playoffs, Jokic averaged 32.3 minutes per game, with 31.0 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists.
