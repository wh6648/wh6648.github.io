April 21 News, Brooklyn basketball star James - harden in yesterday's training suffered hamstring injury recurrence, after MRI examination, the team announced that harden will be absent indefinitely. In addition, head coach Steve Nash revealed that Kevin Durant also accepted the inspection, the situation is more optimistic than harden.

"It's back to the starting point again," Nash said in an interview. "We'll get him (harden) back to health. We can get him back anytime, but we don't know when it will be. We will get him back to the best possible condition and hope that day will come soon, but there is no guarantee. Harden may miss the first few games of the playoffs, may also come back early, now everything is unknown

Nash said harden didn't fall down or perform an action that made him feel uncomfortable. "He (harden) just felt the problem. He didn't fall, he didn't trip, he didn't have anything unusual. He just felt a little nervous, so it was a repeated injury, and the scan results confirmed that he suffered repeated injuries. So there is no more information than disappointment, we have to start over and get him healthy again

Speaking of Durant's situation, Nash said he was more optimistic than harden's. "Durant was diagnosed with injury after a collision with heat defender Trevor Ariza, but his condition is more positive than that of harden. Durant also accepted MRI today, the results are more reassuring, he is currently in the daily observation list. I hope he can come back soon. We'll see about him next week
