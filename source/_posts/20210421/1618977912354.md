On April 21, NBA officials announced the latest issue of defense player of the year (DPOY) list today. Gobel and Simmons continue to rank in the top two, Adebayor rose to No.3.

1. Rudy Gerber (jazz, first place last week)

Gerber limited his opponent's shooting percentage to 42.8%. Statistics show that this is the Jazz center's second season of his career, with 1000 points, 1000 rebounds and 200 blocks. Obviously, Gerber is currently the league's best defensive big man.

2. Ben Simmons (76ers, 2nd place last week)

Simmons is as stable as ever, he is the 76ers defense expert. On the defensive side, he can defend multiple positions and move flexibly. Maybe projection is not Simmons' strong point, but he really focuses on defense.

3. BAM Adebayor (heat, 4th place last week)

Remember Adebayor's final? In fact, against the nets last week, his defensive performance is more profound. Nets players face Adebayor, 17 shot only 3, including Carey Owen 8 shot 0. Therefore, Adebayor rose to the third place on the list.

4. Janice adtokumbo (bucks, 5th place last week)

5. Miles Turner (Pacers, third place last week)
