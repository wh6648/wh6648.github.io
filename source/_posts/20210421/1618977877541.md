On April 21, a Minneapolis City Court in Minnesota today convicted Derek Chauvin, a former White policeman, of kneeling and killing George Freud, an African American man, outside a local convenience store in May last year, A jury of six white, four black and two multi-ethnic people found Drake Shawan guilty of second degree murder, third degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

Xiao Wan faces a maximum sentence of 40 years for the second degree murder, 25 years for the third degree murder and 10 years for the second degree negligent homicide. Judge Peter Cahill announced that Xiao Wan's bail had been withdrawn immediately and his sentence was arranged eight weeks later.

Police initially issued a statement saying that Freud died in a "medical accident.". The next day, witnesses posted a video of Shawan kneeling on Freud's neck. In the face of growing protests in Minneapolis and across the country, police said the FBI would investigate. In the trial, the judge held Shawan responsible for Freud's death because he pressed his knee on Freud's neck. The defense argued that Freud's death was due to the drugs in his body and pre-existing health conditions. Three other police officers have also been arrested and will be tried together this summer.

"The murder of George Freud a year ago brought unimaginable pain and trauma to his family, the Minneapolis community and communities across the country. Since this unjust tragedy, we have been thinking about the Freudian family. Throughout our history, racial and social injustices are deeply rooted in our communities. We hope that today's verdict is a step forward, but it does not alleviate the physical and emotional suffering that persists in an environment of systemic racism. " Minnesota Timberwolves and WNBA Minnesota Bobcats jointly issued a statement.

Freud's death sparked a nationwide protest, prompting athletes in the sports world to cry out for social and racial injustice. In the week of Freud's death, former NBA player Stephen Jackson went to Minnesota. In a touching speech with other NBA players Carl Anthony Downes and Josh okoggi, he said, "I'm sad, I'm angry, but I'm not afraid." Celtic player Jay Brown drove 15 hours to Atlanta for a protest.

"We're happy to see justice done, but there's still a lot to do." The NBA and the players' Union jointly issued a statement. WNBA said the ruling was "a step towards justice."

Atlanta Hawks temporary coach Nate - McMillan said that if the verdict is different, then the hawks and Magic game will be carried out, it is not sure. "We, as a league, really don't know if we will play this game again. I think the jury did their job. You have to hold everyone responsible for their actions. The jury found him (Xiao Wan) guilty of three charges. I think they did their job. " McMillan said.

"The year after George Freud's death was extremely painful for the Minnesota community, especially for the black residents of the state. Although today's verdict does not minimize suffering or address the intolerable problems of racism and hatred, we hope it marks the beginning of community healing. Now, more than ever, it is important to listen respectfully, communicate and participate so that we can move towards a fair society... Our work has just begun and our commitment is unswerving. " The Minnesota Vikings said in a statement.

In addition, tennis player Naomi Osaka said: "I wanted to send a congratulatory tweet, but I suddenly feel very sad, because what we celebrate is obvious, so many unfair things have happened, let's hold our breath for such a result, which can explain the problem."
