On May 19, the 2020-21 NBA playoff playoff playoff play off began, Celtic 118-100 home beat the wizards, successfully locked in the eastern seventh.

Throughout the game, Green Army Core Jason Tatum burst out, he scored 50 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks, 32 shots and 14 goals.

Although only 23 years old, Tatum has seen enough big scenes in the first three years of his career.

But this season, for the green shirt, for Tatum, is extremely difficult. In the regular season, affected by injuries, the green army's lineup rotation was cut to pieces. At the end of the regular season, Tatum's most reliable partner, Jay brown, also suffered a torn wrist ligament.

As a result, as the top team in the East in the past, the green shirt team is now reduced to the point of playing a playoff.

Today's game started, Tatum inevitably fell into the encirclement of the opponent. Of course, the wizard knew the power of Rex Rabbit, so he tried his best to lower his hit rate.

At least in the first quarter, Tatum was in trouble. It was not until the middle of the section that he hit his first goal of the game through the outside projection. As long as he got the ball, he was always one in front of and one behind, and the two were limited. Tatum had no goal in the attack, and could only rely on the projection from the outside line to maintain his firepower. Fortunately, at the end of this section, Tatum hit again with three points, allowing the green shirt to maintain an 8-point advantage.

In the second quarter, Tatum adjusted the rhythm. As soon as he came up, he made a breakthrough easily. Next, he scored with a free throw. However, on the scene, with other teammates dumb, with the wizard will score over, Tatum is somewhat isolated.

But as the core of the team, Tatum understood the importance of setting an example. When the green army was in the most difficult stage, he didn't rely too much on his teammates for help, but started the crazy attack mode himself,

So, in the latter part of this section, with Tatum's free throw in the company and his strong attack into 2 + 1, the green army seized the score again before half-time.

But this is just the beginning of Tatum's personal performance. In the third quarter, he took out more amazing firepower. First, he made a breakthrough layup to 2 + 1 and scored 20 points. Next, he sent three assists in a row to help Walker score. When the wizard's attention began to shift to Walker's side, Tatum suddenly broke out. In more than a minute, he hit three points twice, made a turn over jump shot, made a free layup, cut 10 points in a row and scored more than 30 points.

After a series of operations, the wizard was completely confused. But Tatum didn't stop scoring. In the latter part of this section, he continued to change his moves to attack the wizard's position. After a successful jump shot, he scored 40 points, and the output of 23 points in a single section was even more amazing.
