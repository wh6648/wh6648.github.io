It was reported on May 19 that the Pacers played a life and death match with the Hornets at home. In the end, the Pacers eliminated the Hornets 144-117. Doug McDermott played 26 minutes, 7-for-9, 4-for-6, 3-for-3, 21 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists, 21 points, plus or minus 20.

For the Pacers, the disadvantage is that the Pacers announced before the game that defender carlis Lowell was absent from the game because of the League health and safety agreement. Lewell's absence is obviously a huge loss, which requires the team to be able to stand up. After the start of the game, the Pacers showed their attitude towards life and death, especially Doug McDermott. In many people's eyes, the 2014 first round No. 11 show is a full shooter, but this season McDermott also developed the skills to rush to the basket and attack the box. 10 minutes 36 seconds, Brogden attack failed, McDermott rushed to grab the rebound, easily put the ball into the net. Then, McDermott opened his own housekeeping skills - three point projection. In the first single quarter, in the 11 minutes of the game, the number of 3-point shots scored by one person is more than that scored by the whole team of the Hornets. The Hornets scored 3-point shots scored 9 times in the first quarter. With McDermott's 16 points in the first quarter, the Pacers scored 40 points in a single quarter, 16 points better than the Hornets.

With 5 minutes and 18 seconds left in the second quarter, McDermott made a comeback. As the team-mates feel good at this time, McDermott didn't rush to choose personal attack after he came up. After three minutes, he chose to shoot. The last minute of the quarter, McDermott also slipped to the basket to complete the layup, the end of the first half of the game has 20 points.

In the second half of the game, McDermott chose only one shot in the third quarter because of the big lead, leaving more opportunities for his teammates. Sabonis, who has been struggling for rebounds before, started his own scoring mode, scoring 12 points in a single quarter, helping the Pacers to get a 30 point lead at the end of the three quarters. As the outcome is not too much suspense, McDermott did not appear in the fourth quarter.

McDermott signed a three-year $22 million contract with the walkers in 2018. This year off-season, he will be able to discuss with the team and sign a new contract. McDermott played the best season of his career this season. In 66 regular season games for the Pacers, he averaged 13.6 points per game and 53.2% of his shooting percentage, all of which were career high. McDermott has become an important member of the rotation lineup of the Pacers, and even the best shooter of the Pacers. This summer, the Pacers are likely to renew their contract with McDermott.
