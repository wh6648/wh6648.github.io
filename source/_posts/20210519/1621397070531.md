It was reported on May 19 that the regular season of 2020-21 has ended. Although free agent Lin Shuhao has "fully proved" his ability as an NBA player, he has not signed with any team so far. Today, Lin posted a long article on the social network, disclosing his plan to return to the NBA this season and his disappointment that he has not been awarded any contract in the past year. The following is the content of the open letter:

I know I'm still an NBA player. My agent and I talked to other teams, but they all asked me if I had enough desire, health and skill to maintain the NBA level.

For months, I've watched other players get contracts, opportunities. I told myself that with a 10 day contract and a chance to get back on the court, I could smash these doubts. After all, that's how my whole basketball career started - an opportunity to prove myself. For reasons I'll never fully know, that opportunity never came true. I'm still an NBA player and I've proved that I'm better than ever. As I said before, to have a big dream means to take the risk of sadness.

I know I've been very lucky. I've had an NBA career that I never dreamed of. I spent a year chasing my dream. My family, team and business partners all support me to pursue my dream. I gave up playing in China and went back to the Development League. I'm really trying to realize my dream, but my career in NBA is far beyond my imagination.

For the next generation of Asian American players, I hope I can do more in the NBA to break more barriers and inspire you more, especially now. When you get the chance, don't hesitate, don't worry about whether others will think you belong there. When you have stepped into the door, kick the door open, and then bring others with you.

I didn't fulfill my dream, I believe it's God's preparation for me... Thank you all who accompany me through this journey, love you.

This season, Lin played nine games in the Development League, averaging 19.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 6.4 assists, with a shooting percentage of 50.5% and a three-point shooting percentage of 42.6%.
