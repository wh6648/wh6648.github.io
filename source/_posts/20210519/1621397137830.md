On May 19, the NBA entered the playoff playoff playoffs. The following is the outlook for tomorrow's events:

Warriors vs Lakers (10:00)

Stephen curry was the victim of LeBron James. They met four times in the finals and curry won three of them. The warriors will fight for the seventh seed in the playoff playoff playoffs with the Lakers tomorrow, writing a new chapter in their feud. It is worth mentioning that this is also the first time in the history of the western region between the seventh and eighth teams. The Lakers and warriors have played three times in the regular season, leading the warriors 2-1.

There is no doubt that the focus of this game is the super giant match between James and curry. This game is also the 39th match between James and curry (including the playoffs). In the previous 38 games, curry won 22 and James 16; Curry averaged 23.6 points, 6.4 assists and 43.7% shooting percentage, while James averaged 30.4 points, 8.1 assists and 49.4% shooting percentage.

It is worth mentioning that since 2016, curry has only averaged 17.8 points in the Staples Center field, with a three-point shooting rate of only 23.5%. In the last eight games, staples made 16 of 77 three-point shots, shooting 20.8%. Obviously, the Laker's defense to curry is very good. When they come to the Staples Center again tomorrow, curry's challenge is still very huge. This season, the defensive efficiency of the Lakers in the regular season has reached 106.8, which is the first time that the team has ranked first in the League since the 1999-2000 season.

In fact, the warriors have thought of that¡° They (the Lakers) will do everything they can to guard against curry, multiple defenders, different pairs, quick clips and so on Braves coach Cole said.

James stepped on Alexander Walker's foot and sprained his ankle in the final game against pelicans. Coach Vogel said James did have a slight sore ankle, but he took part in the team's training today and could play in tomorrow's playoff. Anthony Davis, another core of the Lakers, also said in an interview that his adductor and shoulder feel very good. He is now very healthy and ready to take part in tomorrow's play off with the warriors.

Spurs vs Grizzlies (07:30)

The Spurs had a bad performance late in the regular season, losing 10 of the past 12 games and ending the season with a wave of four losses in a row. But now these are not important, they have to put all their energy on tomorrow's life and death battle with Grizzlies, the winner still has the chance to compete for the eighth place in the West.

"It's an opportunity that we can take advantage of," said spurs core Rodriguez, "to go from one game to another and see what happens." It's very important for the Spurs to return to the playoffs. The Spurs have never been out of the playoffs for two consecutive seasons. For the Spurs, Derozan's performance is very important. Although the defensive end is still at the hip, his organizational ability has reached the peak level of his career, averaging 6.9 assists this season, a career high.

Grizzlies, on the other hand, are no strangers to the playoffs. Last season, grizzlies played a playoff with the pioneers in the Orlando Disneyland Park, but Grizzlies finally lost. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins is proud that the team has played in the playoffs for two consecutive seasons, but he also understands that they still need to work hard to meet their expectations. For Grizzlies, they have to win two games in the playoffs to qualify for the playoffs.

"We can't put too much pressure on ourselves." "Obviously, we know what's at stake and we have to be prepared," Grizzlies guard Jia Morant said. Our goal is to win, so we don't think about losing at all
