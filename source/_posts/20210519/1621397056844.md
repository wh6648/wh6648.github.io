This battle, the wizard and the green army's competition, originally the wizard core Bradley bill hamstring injury has not recovered. However, in order to win, he came back with injury.

It is undeniable that Bill played very hard after his comeback, but in such a high-intensity game, the difficulty of playing with injuries is also obvious. After the opening, bill more is to pass to teammates, and until this quarter reached 5:03 seconds, he only by dunking the first two points of the game.

But Bill's persistence, to a certain extent, inspired the wizard's fighting spirit. In the first quarter fell into a passive situation, the second quarter, the wizard tenacious counterattack, and the score successfully over.

However, bill is not the only one to fight with injuries. On the green shirt side, smart, as Bill's counterpart, worked very hard. In the second quarter, he was injured twice in a short time. However, after adjustment, smart fought back twice.

In such a fierce game, no one is willing to give up the victory, bill is no exception, after the second quarter, in the case of poor outside feel, Bill strengthened the short-range attack, although the state is far from 100%, but through a burst shot, half-time, his score still came to 13 points.

With injury, bill has tried his best, but on the scene, the green army is the better side in scoring and firepower. When Yi Bian fought again, the green army set off a frenzy of attack, and Tatum took over the attack completely. Although, Bill's layup is still scoring piecemeal, but in front of Tatum's dazzling light, his play has been completely covered.

In the latter part of the third quarter, Bill scored three points and got 20 points. But obviously, he also knows that it is very difficult to get it back. Of course, the rules of this year's playoffs give the Wizards two chances. Although they lose today's game, they can still fight with the Pacers for the last place in the playoffs.
