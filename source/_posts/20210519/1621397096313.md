Four specific scores (Pacers in front): 40-24, 29-21, 39-33, 36-39.

Facing a life and death play off, the Pacers' situation is not optimistic. The team's main players Warren, Turner and lamb are all absent due to injuries, and Lowell is also unable to participate because of violating the health and safety regulations before the game. Fortunately, Brogden's return from the fire line has injected a dose of strength into the Pacers. Hornets, in addition to Hayward absent due to injury, the team is relatively more complete lineup.

As soon as the game came up, Brogden, who had not been on the court for a long time, first hit three points, then made a good throw from the basket, and then changed to a layup. He scored seven points in a row to help the Pacers get the first chance. After that, McDermott scored three points in a row, and Brisset also scored on the outside line. The Pacers made a dream start of 20-7. Although the Hornets began to hit some three-point goals and Rozier scored five points in a row, the momentum of the whole game has completely shifted to the Pacers. McDermott continued his excellent outside touch, and Brisset also fired from outside from time to time. On the other hand, the Hornets could not match the walkers' firepower completely, and the first quarter showed a one-sided situation. The Pacers took a 40-24 lead in the first quarter with Sumner's pressure shot.

The offensive efficiency of the walkers in the second quarter began to decline, and the hit rate was not as exaggerated as that in the first quarter, but the overall defense intensity was increasing, which obviously made full preparation for the playoff. Once up, they scored 5 points again, and the difference was also pulled to 20 points. As for the Hornets, facing the aggressive momentum of the Pacers, they felt confused. Although once played 6-0 chase points, but the overall feeling of the offensive end is not good, three-point strike frequently, sometimes there are mistakes. On the defensive side, the Hornets can't match the strength of the walkers. The counterattack is played casually, the rotation defense is not active, and the point difference is always kept at 20 points. With Justin hollerdy's three-point shot, the Pacers took a 69-45 lead in the first half, building a huge advantage of 24 points.

Yi Bian fight again, the Hornets defense is still full of holes, half-time up the pacer is a wave of 7-0, the difference directly to 30 points. Since then, although the Hornets played a wave of 6-0 close to the score, but the Pacers obviously did not take it lightly, even 4 points, the situation will be stable. Although the Hornets in the third quarter of the offensive efficiency has finally improved, but in the defensive side has always been unable to form any restrictions on the walker's attack, McDermott continues to score his own performance, SA is all the time to show his all-round and excellent offensive and passing ability. The Pacers scored three points in a row, and the difference came to 30 points again. With McConnell's drifting shot, the Pacers led 108-78 in three quarters.

The last quarter of the game is basically reduced to garbage time, although the Hornets did not give up the game, but even the Pacers substitute players, also in the first three quarters of momentum led to show a very strong combat effectiveness. The Hornets didn't get any advantage in front of the Pacers' substitutes at all. The difference was once pulled to nearly 40 points. When the situation was over, the Hornets removed the net number of the main players and lost the suspense of the game. In the end, the Pacers beat the Hornets 144-117 to win the first game of the playoff.

Pacers start: Malcolm Brogden, domantas sabonis, Doug McDermott, O'Shea Brisset, and Justin hollerdy.
