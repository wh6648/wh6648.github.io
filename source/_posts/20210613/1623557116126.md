It was reported on June 13 that Kevin Durant broke through with the ball and PJ Tucker was fouled when he played 4:21 in the third quarter of G3 in the eastern semifinals. Then the two face-to-face sprayed rubbish words, when Durant's personal bodyguard rushed to the stage and angrily pushed Tucker. Golden State Warriors star and TNT commentator Raymond Green also gave his own views on the conflict. Dream pursuit said that today's league has become so weak that both sides have to need bodyguards to resolve the conflict.

"The league has become so weak, the court is full of security personnel, and the two have to be safely isolated. This incident can definitely be regarded as two people just want to spray some rubbish words on each other, which often happens in sports Dream Green said.

It is worth mentioning that, according to the latest report, Durant's personal bodyguard has been suspended. This security guard will no longer work at Milwaukee home during the Eastern Conference semi-finals, nor will he be assigned to the court area of the basketball nets.
