On June 13, the NBA playoffs are in progress. Here are the prospects for tomorrow's events:

Nets (2-1) vs bucks (1-2) (03:00)

Came to Milwaukee with a 2-0 lead. However, the team feel bad, coupled with the Bucks aggressive defense, the nets were 9-30 behind in the first quarter, and finally lost the game by 3 points, the series score was pulled to 2-1. According to manager Nash, James Harden will continue to miss the fourth game of the Bucks series because of tight hamstrings, but Jeff Green's condition has been upgraded to doubt and he may return in G4.

In the third game, the net made 8 of 32 three-point shots, with a shooting rate of only 25%, which is far behind the 43.2% three-point shooting rate in the first seven playoffs. In addition, the whole team only had 8 free throws, not aggressive. Speaking of the key fourth game, Owen said: "the fourth game should be special. We have to be able to deal with it better and be ready to fight hard. The third game has proved that the trend can develop in any direction and many things can be controlled by us

Durant averaged 30.3 points, 8 rebounds and 4.7 assists in the semi-final, but in the G3 game, although Durant shot 28 times, he only hit 11 goals, with a 39.3% shooting rate, which was the lowest in the playoffs. Durant also said that in the G4 competition, we should prepare our body and mind, and then play round by round.

It is no exaggeration to say that G3 is the world of alphabet brother and Middleton. Alphabet brother played 43 minutes, made 14 of 31 shots, scored 33 points and 14 rebounds; Middleton scored 35 points and 15 rebounds, especially in the last crucial moment, which helped the team to win. In the next four games, I hope they can still play like this at home, play aggressively, try their best to win and level the score.

Sun (3-0) vs Nuggets (0-3) (08:00)

Before the third game of the Western semi-finals, Nikolay Jokic won the MVP of this season's regular season, which is the league's recognition of the Nuggets star's outstanding performance. However, after the award ceremony, the Suns quickly proved that they are a better team with a convincing victory. The Suns are leading 3-0 by a big margin and have a chance to finish the series tomorrow. It is worth mentioning that the Suns had two previous 3-0 lead in the playoffs, and both finished sweeping the opponents in the next game. In addition, according to statistics, there have been 142 times in the history of the playoffs when the score is 0-3, and no team has ever completed the reversal. In the history, only three teams can drag the game into the seventh place when they are 0-3 behind, but they still regret to lose in the end.

Despite a big 3-0 lead, the Suns know that Nuggets will fight hard¡° We know those people won't give up, they have the league's MVP, they have a great head coach Mike Malone, they have some players who play very hard. No one wants their season to come to an end, so we know they will do their best, but we are ready Said Devon Booker.

Jokic has done everything he can. In the G3 game, he scored 32 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists, becoming the third player in NBA history to get 30 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists in the playoffs since Jabbar and Chamberlain. However, the Suns controlled everyone around Jokic, Gordon shot 2 out of 10, and little Potter scored only 13.7 points in the whole series. This also directly led to the decline of the team's overall offensive level. According to statistics, the Nuggets only scored 101.7 points per game against the suns in this series. As a comparison, they scored 120.8 points per game against the Blazers in the first round.

Talking about the team falling into the situation of 0-3 behind, Jokic said: "the next fourth game is to give everything on the field. If you lose, you will be out. We are fighting at home. We are going to fight on the field, do our best and do whatever we need to do. This is our mentality."
