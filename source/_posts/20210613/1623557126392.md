On June 13, according to reports from the US media, NBA officials have dealt with the issue of Kevin Durant's personal bodyguard. As a result, the security guard will no longer work at the Milwaukee home court during the Eastern Conference semifinals, nor will he be assigned to the basketball nets' court area (during the Nets' home court).

In this week's G3 series, the nets lost to the bucks. During the game, Durant and PJ Tucker quarreled and caused conflicts. At that time, the referee separated the two and KD's personal bodyguards rushed to the court to maintain order.

It is reported that after KD's personal bodyguard rushed into the stadium, he used his body to protect KD behind him. According to "the Olympic" reporter Joe Walden get the tip, this is the nets for KD hired private bodyguard.

"To be honest, I don't know if the team management has asked the League to investigate the KD bodyguards' collision with Tucker," bucks coach Mike budenhower said of the private bodyguards

"I know KD and his bodyguards, and I think the reason why he (KD's personal bodyguard) entered the stadium and made these moves is just to complete his own work," bucks guard Zhu huoledi said

"But KD's bodyguards hit Tucker a little bit hard, so I'm not sure if he should have done it," huoledi continued. "I think the league or the team have to deal with it."
