June 13 news, the past few seasons, as long as the playoffs, Paul - George's state will appear great fluctuations. ESPN mouthpiece and former NBA star Kent Perkins has previously said that he is not optimistic about George's better performance in the playoffs because he is often invisible in the playoffs. Today, former NBA player and current basketball commentator Jay Ross also fired at George, saying that he is not a superstar or even the best player in his team.

In the summer of 2019, when the Clippers put Paul George and Coway Leonard together, this team immediately became the favorite to win the championship in the Western Conference. Many people think that they are the best duo in the NBA today. Although Leonard's status as a league superstar remains basically unchanged, time is not so friendly to George. Ever since George came to this team that has suffered a series of setbacks in the playoffs, countless fans and basketball experts have questioned his value.

"Paul George is not a superstar, he is not even the best player on the team. Is Anthony Davis a superstar? For me, being a great player and the best player in the NBA doesn't necessarily mean being a superstar in my eyes. Superstar means "we're great because of you." Said Jay Ross.

When it comes to the fate of the clippers, what they really care about is what Coway Leonard can bring them. Although George is excellent, is he as irreplaceable as it seems?
