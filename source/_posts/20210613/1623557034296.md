On June 13, the NBA playoffs continued. The clippers, who were 2-0 behind in the Western Conference semi-final, returned to their home court to fight the jazz. In the end, the Clippers beat the Jazz 132-106 and pulled the big score to 1-2. Leonard scored 34 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists in 14 of 24 shots.

In the first two consecutive losing games, Leonard's performance can only be regarded as unsatisfactory, 23 points in a game and 21 points in a game, which is obviously far from enough in the Western semi-finals. In the first half of this game, Leonard's performance is also quite bad, his shooting hand is very poor, at the beginning of the game, he was suddenly robbed, stopped three points, and couldn't move forward. Although he made a strong layup to help the Clippers take advantage of the opportunity to surpass the score, he still failed to make two shots after that and only relied on the continuous make-up to make fouls and score hard in two free throws.

At the end of the second quarter, when Mitchell kept scoring to catch up with the score, Leonard finally made a little contribution. First, he steals and counterattacks, then he stops in a hurry and makes a hit in the middle shot, and joins hands with George to respond. In the first half, Leonard scored 10 points from 4-for-12 shots, which was obviously not enough for the Clippers. At the beginning of the second half, Leonard had an explosion.

As soon as he came up, he snatched the ball, then received it under the basket. In singles, O'Neal turned around and then made a negative angle one handed throw. Then he broke through the assist Batum and made a three-point dash. With the help of the cover, he made a quick stop and shot again. On the counterattack, he received a wonderful pass from the middle and finished the one handed smash. Unfortunately, the ball was not effective because of the foul, but soon he made a stronger response, He used the cover to break through the two men's siege on the line, sent out the gliding slam dunk under the direct kill basket, followed by a strong bottom line backhand layup, and then entered again. After the pause, he made a long-range shot directly against favos.

In the first half of the third quarter, he scored 10 points in five shots to help the Clippers maintain a 15 point lead. In the second half of the third quarter, Leonard was a little quiet. He couldn't make a shot in a sudden stop, and couldn't make a three-point retreat. However, he gave a wonderful assist. In a breakthrough, he jumped up from the basket and encountered a siege in the air. He temporarily changed his mind and made a three-point jump to Kennard in the bottom corner when he was about to land.

At the end of the game, Leonard made a straight shot from the bottom of the basket in the counterattack. When the Clippers made a series of mistakes, when the Jazz wanted to get up, Leonard made a 2 + 1 shot from the high throw in the counterattack, followed by a three-point shot with the help of cover, and then a three-point shot from bartum, which widened the difference to 21 points under his continuous attack belt, and then a misplaced strong shot from gobel, Then there was an emergency stop, and the difference was further extended to 22 points, and the game was completely out of suspense.

This game, Leonard in the first half of the poor performance, but the second half has become the winner, especially in the last quarter of the continuous scoring completely lock the game.
