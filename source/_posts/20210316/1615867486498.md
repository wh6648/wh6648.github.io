On March 16, the Clippers beat the lone Rangers 109-99 away. Paul George made 5 of 18 shots, 2 of 6 three-point shots, contributed 15 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, and made four mistakes. Coway Leonard made 9 of 20 shots, 1 of 5 three-point shots, 22 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals.

In the last game against pelicans, the Clippers not only suffered a 20 point defeat, but more importantly, team general Ibaka suffered back injury in the game and left the game midway, and missed today's game with the lone ranger. Pelican said that if the team did not play hard against the Clippers after 50 points, then it would not play hard. Clippers star Coway - Leonard for the team's performance is also very dissatisfied, and frankly everyone needs to play harder, at the same time, he is also very worried about the stability of the team.

In the current clipper team, Leonard partner Paul George's performance is the most unstable. George's performance this season can be described as a surprise for the clippers, getting rid of the problem of inefficient attack last season. But the all star game is a dividing line. George before the all star is unstoppable, and George after the all star is unstoppable. In the game against warriors, George made 5 of 15 in the game; in the last game against pelicans, George made 5 of 14 shots.

Against the lone ranger today, George's performance in the first half was even more worrying. He only made 3 of 11 shots in the half, made 0 of 4 shots in the three-point shot, and made three mistakes. Compared with George, Leonard's performance is remarkable. After the start of the game, Leonard continued to attack the basket. When the lone ranger will score close, Leonard can also stand up to help the Clippers to stabilize the morale. In the first half, Leonard made four of seven shots and scored eight points.

In another long-distance battle, George still couldn't find the rhythm and shot basketball twice in a row. As a result of the state is not good, George is very hesitant in the offensive end, even if there is a mobile phone, George will pass the ball to his teammates. Leonard scored three points in 4:39 seconds, the offensive efficiency also plummeted, the next four consecutive shots were unsuccessful.

The game entered the key fourth quarter, George was still completely out of shape, until 8:53, George scored the first three points of the game. A few rounds later, Leonard reached the penalty area with the ball, ignored the lone ranger player christaps polzingis's defense and put on a one arm dunk. When the lone ranger kept approaching the score, Leonard came out again and made continuous breakthroughs to help the team stabilize their morale. George failed to attack, Leonard took off the key rebounds, and played 2 + 1 on Hadaway. In 26.3 seconds, George scored a key three, and the Clippers expanded their advantage to 10. In 17.1 seconds, Leonard steals Richardson again, and the Clippers are sure to win.
