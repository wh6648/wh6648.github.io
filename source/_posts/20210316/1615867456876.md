March 16 news, from the "Yahoo Sports" reporter Chris - Hannes reported that informed sources revealed that the Rockets star John - wall may be in charge of the season at some point on the left knee thorough inspection.

Once the Rockets do so, it means the end of wall's season.

Last week, wall suffered knee contusion in training and has been absent for three consecutive games. Sources said that wall's knee injury is not serious, he is expected to return soon. It is expected that he will suffer from knee problems this season. After all, he has had major knee surgery before.

Before the start of the season, the rockets and the Wizards completed a deal, wall and Russell Westbrook completed the swap. Since coming to Houston, wall has played very hard, but there is still a big gap from his peak period.

Especially after James Harden was traded to leave the team, there was no chemical reaction between wall and Victor oradibo. On the other hand, because of wall's injury history, it is very difficult for the Rockets to sell him.

Wall's current contract expires in the summer of 2023, with 22-23 as a player option. This season, wall's annual salary is as high as $41.25 million.

So far this season, wall has played 25 games for the Rockets, averaging 21.0 points, 3.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists.
