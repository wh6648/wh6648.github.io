It was reported on June 8 that in the second match between the nets and the bucks in the eastern semi-final, the nets slaughtered the bucks with a huge advantage of 125-86, rewriting the total score of the series to 2-0.

In the absence of harden, Owen and Durant scored 54 points, which not only helped the team occupy a very favorable position in the series, but also destroyed the Bucks' confidence to a great extent.

In addition to audu, Griffin's contribution to this battle should not be underestimated. On the defensive side, he used his strong body to hold the letter brother's footwall. In the case of obvious height difference, he forced the letter brother to stay away from the three second area to finish the end, and received a very significant effect. On the offensive side, Griffin made two slam dunks, one of which was to smash the ball into the basket through the letter brother, which can be described as killing people.

I believe that before the series, no one believed that Griffin could have such a good performance in the process of defending the letter brother. However, it turns out that you can never underestimate the heart of a champion. In the future competition, Griffin will still shoulder the responsibility of single defense letter brother, do not give the latter the chance to attract the pinch, the Bucks outside shooter group is very difficult to find a good opportunity.

It is because of Griffin's enough responsibility that Durant is able to avoid occasionally on the defensive end and devote all his energy to the offensive end. In contrast to bucks, no one can stop Durant unless brother Letterman comes out in person, and Durant still has the advantage in speed and sensitivity even if brother Letterman keeps an eye on him. Although brother Letterman has excellent height and strength and can interfere with Durant's long-range shot, he can't keep up with Durant's quick breakthrough like a guard. However, the excessive consumption in the defensive end, in turn, affects the offensive efficiency of Letterman, resulting in a vicious circle.

Besides Durant, Owen can't be limited by one person. Bucks core guard Gerardo hollody has been known for his excellent defense for many years, but it is difficult for him to play in front of Owen's attacking kaleidoscope. Especially because the team has so many attacking points, Owen doesn't need to shoulder the heavy responsibility of single challenge most of the time. He just needs to wait for the opportunity and use one or two moves occasionally when the opponent is about to rise to power to quickly cut points and firmly control the situation in his own hands.
