The last off-season, the Lakers signed little Gasol, almost all fans are happy, which is understandable. Theoretically speaking, little Gasol is exactly the type of center the Lakers need to be able to fight side by side with Anthony Davis in the front court.

However, after a season, little Gasol became the backup center because of the signing of Zhuang Shen in the middle of the season. His future in the team is still unknown.

Obviously, Pau Gasol is one of the only five contract guaranteed players for the Lakers next season, but he doesn't know where he is in the team's off-season plan.

"Obviously, they have a lot of decisions to make, and my problem is not the first of those decisions." "We'll see what the team is doing later this summer, what they want to do and what their plans are," Gasol said. Now, I think everything is very new. No one wants to hold these meetings now. I don't think they know what the plan is yet. We all need time to reflect on it. "

"Thank you very much for this year's Laker career, I know it obviously didn't end the way we expected, but for me personally, it's better than looking from the outside. I enjoy some things that have happened, but there are also things that I don't enjoy, but I try to be positive. As I said, I appreciate the opportunity here

The Lakers have a variety of ways to deal with Pau Gasol this summer. They can keep Pau Gasol and try to rebuild the relationship between the team and him next season. Or they can end their partnership by trading or cutting Xiaojia. In addition, the Lakers can try to negotiate a contract with him to buy out, which is not seriously discussed by Pau Gasol and the Lakers this season.

From the perspective of basketball, buyout also has certain significance for Gasol. But the significance of basketball is not the only thing that little Gasol considered when he decided to join the Lakers last year¡° I mean, there are different aspects of life, "he said." it's like, it's your job, you have the opportunity to play with players like James, to understand what this team is like. I don't need anyone to explain to me what a third center is, and we always have a thick eyebrow playing number five or even James playing number five. So once you have two players in front of you, you are the third choice center, or even the fifth. I don't need anyone to explain to me, I understand that. "

"And the family side. My children go to school here, and my wife has a good time living in Los Angeles. Moving was not an ideal choice for me at that time. Maybe if I didn't get married or if I was ten years younger, I would make a different choice. But the reality is that I want to stay here, I want to contribute to the team and I want to help you. And I'm always happy with young people. I enjoy spending time with them. At that time when I didn't have playing time, training with them made me happy Little Gasol said.

"When you give a card you don't like, you can't ask for a new deal. You can only play them as well as you can and be as positive as you can. In the end, it was clear that things started to change and I played a little more. But the season didn't end as I hoped. To be honest, I didn't expect to end up losing at home. I didn't expect that

Although Gasol's experience with the Los Angeles Lakers is disappointing from both a team and a personal point of view, Gareth said his overall experience in Los Angeles was positive, largely because of his teammates.

"I cherish this opportunity very much. I can not only play with James, but also with players like Maurice, Matthews, Schroeder and Harrell Gasol said, "I like all my teammates, and so does pop. I enjoy playing with him. I like all the coaching staff, everyone you may not see in front of the camera, all the medical teams, public relations personnel, media
