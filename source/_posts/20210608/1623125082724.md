On June 8, according to NBA record Joe Walden, warrior star curry is 50% likely to play in Tokyo Olympics.

Curry has few unfinished achievements in basketball, but one important thing is missing from his growing list of personal honors - the Olympic gold medal. He didn't make the U.S. team in 2012. After two consecutive MVP seasons, he decided not to participate in the 2016 Olympic Games.

As the 2020 Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo soon, this summer may be Kuri's last chance to compete for gold on the world's largest stage. The warriors' season ended early in May. Curry didn't make a clear statement about playing for the U.S. team and said he was still considering it.

According to Joe Walden, sources revealed that curry is open-minded about whether he will take part in the Tokyo Olympics.
