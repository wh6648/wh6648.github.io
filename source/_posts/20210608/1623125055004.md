On June 8, the 76ers coach Rivers said in an interview that he hoped the League referee could give Simmons a fair penalty.

Rivers said he had a folder of videos that showed that the referee's scale was unfair to Simmons. Rivers said he wanted the League to cut correctly because the 76ers relied on Simmons' defense to get the team out of the hole where they were 1-0 behind the Hawks.

"We like Simmons' defense against Trey young," Rivers said on the conference call. "Trey young, he's good at fouls. So we need to pay special attention to this. Sometimes he does get fouled, but sometimes he doesn't

The 76ers, who ranked first in the East in the regular season, lost to the eagles, who ranked fifth in the East in G1 of the eastern semi-final. Trey young scored 35 points, 11 of 23 shots and 9 of 9 free throws.

Simmons fouled his back four times in G1, which rivers thinks is due to his 2.06 meter height¡° Aggression shouldn't be a foul, "Rivers said." I did one thing, cataloguing these rounds. So it's not just trejan. All in all, it's the rounds in which Simmons used his body to make a good defense but was called foul. His body is his weapon. He didn't do anything against the rules. "

"I remember a lot of games. When I heard the whistle, I thought," wait, it's good defense! " That's it, but you always have to adapt to the rules. That's one thing I've always stressed to the players. But you should never be called foul for having a hard, legal, physical defense
