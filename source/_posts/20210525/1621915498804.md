On May 25, reports from US media said that in an interview today, Laker coach Frank Vogel talked about the effect of Anthony Davis as the center.

According to statistics, in the 12 minutes and 44 seconds when G1 was the center, the Lakers had a net loss of 9 points; While others served as centers, the Lakers drew with the suns. So, will G2 thick eyebrow still appear in the center position? Or, how long will he play at center?

"It's not sure because there are a lot of factors at work," Vogel said. To be honest, I'm hesitant to go into this topic because I don't want to reveal our lineup tomorrow night. Obviously, from the data point of view, when the thick eyebrow hit the center, his performance is obviously not as good as before against the warriors

Suns star Devon Booker scored 34 points in G1. So is there a problem with pop's defense? In response, Vogel said: "all of us need to do better on the defensive side."

"It's clear that the lineup will change," said the Lakers center Andre Drummond, referring to the G2. We will try our best to win the game and we have to do better against Booker

"I think we need to get him into shape at the beginning of the game," said Zhuang. Of course, I'm trying to do my best and help the team as much as I can
