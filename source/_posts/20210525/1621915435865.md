LeBron James recently violated NBA health and safety regulations on May 25, but he was not suspended in the first round against the suns. Earlier this week, James took part in a brand promotion campaign in support of Lobos 1707, a tequila brand, ahead of the game between the Lakers and the warriors.

Both the league and the Lakers knew about it, but James was not suspended because the incident did not rise to the threat level of virus spread. Today, NBA chief liaison officer Mike buss issued a statement explaining the violation of the League health and safety agreement by Laker forward LeBron James.

"To clarify any possible misconceptions, James briefly took part in an outdoor activity last week, where the participants had been vaccinated or tested negative for nucleic acid. In this case, after consulting with medical experts, the alliance believes that his presence will not lead to the risk associated with the spread of the new coronavirus, so there is no need to be quarantined. In this season, there have been many similar violations of the League health and safety agreement, and they have adopted a similar approach to James

"Under current NBA rules, vaccinated players are allowed to take part in outdoor activities, including their personal business activities, such as sponsorship or advertising."
