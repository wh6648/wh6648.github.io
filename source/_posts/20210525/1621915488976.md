On May 25, it was reported that Lin Shuhao left a deep impression after signing with the Santa Cruz warriors of Golden State Warriors Development League, but unfortunately he did not win the favor of NBA teams. However, this did not stop Lin from pursuing his NBA dream¡¶ New York Times reporter Marc Stein reports that the former Harvard star will continue to prepare for next season.

"The 32 year old Lin made a comeback in the Development League this season, but became the only player in the top 11 players in the league's scoring list who didn't get the NBA call-up. Lin has made sure he plans to continue playing and is preparing for next season, and he is evaluating his options Marc Stein reports.

In the past few months, especially after the Atlanta massacre, Lin has been actively supporting the Asian community. This season, Lin played nine games in the Development League, averaging 19.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 6.4 assists, with a shooting percentage of 50.5% and a three-point shooting percentage of 42.6%.
