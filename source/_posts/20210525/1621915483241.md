On May 25, reports from the US media said that after training today, Suns coach Monty Williams was interviewed. Williams said star Chris Paul is expected to play in G2.

The G1 suns beat the Lakers at home with a 1-0 lead. But Paul suffered a shoulder injury in G1 and returned to the dressing room twice during the game. The media and fans are concerned. Can Paul play in G2?

Talking about Paul's injury, Williams said: "his shoulder is not as painful as yesterday, but it's still very painful. Paul is expected to play game 2 of the series, unless there are some accidents

After the G1 game, Paul also made it clear that he would definitely play in G2.

In the first game of the series, one of the main reasons why the Suns were able to overturn the defending champion was that they did a good job in limiting Anthony Davis. In response, Williams said: "we're just trying to make ad feel bad on the court, but sometimes these players just miss the shots. So we don't pay special attention to AD

Speaking of G2, Williams said: "today we watched the game video and then trained. One thing we have to do better is stop the Lakers from getting more possession
