On May 25, the Bucks beat the heat 132-98 at home, leading the heat 2-0 in the first round of the playoffs. The third game of the series will be moved to Miami. The Bucks led the heat in three-point hits (22-8), rebounds (61-36), offensive rebounds (21-9), assists (34-20), bench scores (61-53) and fast break scores (25-6).

The Bucks, who have paid more attention to three-point Defense this season, have been hit 20 three-points by the heat in GI. However, there were some qualitative changes in the G2 game. At the end of the first half of the game, the heat only made 4 of 13 three-point shots, with a shooting rate of only 30.8%. The Bucks only made 8 of the heat's 28 three-point shots (28.6% of the shots), three of which were made during the fourth quarter of training.

In addition, in the past two seasons, although the Bucks have made more three-point hits, their three-point hit rate has been in the middle and lower reaches of the league. This season, the Bucks have raised their three-point shooting rate to the top three in the league, but in the first game, they lost their three-point shooting again, only 5 of 31 shots in the whole game, and adetokumbo, Middleton and hollerdy made only 3 of 17 shots in total. In today's game, the Bucks began to attack from the outside. They made 10 of 15 three-point shots in the first quarter and tied the three-point record in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks made 15 of 29 three-point shots in the half-time, which set the Bucks half-time three-point hit record. It is also the second highest number of three-point hits in NBA history in the first half of the playoffs. The Bucks hit 22 three-point shots, setting a new playoff team record. The previous record was 20 three-point shots against Celtic in 19 years. The Bucks finally got rid of the nightmare of losing three points in the playoffs.

More importantly, the joining of Tucker makes the Bucks have an extra weapon in the defense of Butler. They do a good job in the defense of the heat dual core, including Brooke Lopez's impeccable restriction on Adebayor's attack near the basket.

The heat lost because of a slow start, no advantage on the inside and no opening on the outside. But Jimi - Butler and bam - Adebayor this pair of dual nucleus cannot play the leadership role, this is very similar with the series first competition. Butler made 4 of 10 shots in the game. Although the latter made 5 of 11 shots and scored 16 points, he made four mistakes at the same time and didn't play as well as he should. Compared with last year's playoffs, the defenders standing in front of Butler were replaced by bigger letters, namely, adtokumbo and tucker. He didn't have the upper hand in stature and confrontation, and his attack efficiency on the interior declined. It is worth mentioning that Butler's positive and negative value in the first half was - 32, the lowest in the whole game. According to statistics, the positive and negative value of - 32 also created a new career record for Butler, including the regular season and the playoffs. The positive and negative value of the whole field is - 34. How to counterattack the Bucks' defensive strategy is an urgent problem for Butler to solve when he comes back to home.

Adebayor's solution to the problem is clear - more aggressive to the basket and more aggressive to the defense of Lopez. G3 back home, if Butler can not find the state, the defensive end is difficult to contain the Buck's three-point ball, then the heat's prospects are worrying. Buckley, a famous commentator, recently talked about the heat's game with bucks in the middle of the game. Buckley said: "I promise, Bucks will sweep the heat! The heat can't beat them
