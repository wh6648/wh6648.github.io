On May 25, Kevin Pritchard, President of Indiana Pacers basketball operations, plans to keep the status quo for the time being and has yet to make a decision on the future of coach Nate yorklan.

"You can't win 34 games with a eliminated squad without something lucky," Pritchard said. "But there are things we need to do better, and so does he. Now the team has not made any decision, at least not in the near future. I'm evaluating, I'm evaluating every day. "

Pritchard's tepid reaction will certainly raise more questions about Jocelyn's future in Indiana¡° It's really, really bad to see these reports, "Warren said." Nate (Jocelyn) is a good man, everyone loves him, and it's not fair to him. Unfortunately, it's not cool that such false reports spread on the Internet

It's worth mentioning that Jocelyn hasn't been interviewed since he lost to Washington in the playoffs on Thursday¡° "I know I have to do better in this, and I want to do better too," he said "I have a young coach who is really talented in many ways, but he has to do better in people management," Pritchard said. If you are willing to do so, you will learn more from failure than from success, which is half the success. He wants to be a great coach

For walkers, they need to solve two problems. This season, the Pacers only ranked 25th in the league in defense, losing 115.3 points per game¡° In this league, if you don't have a good forward defender, you don't have a chance. We need TJ Warren, "Pritchard continued." when miles (Turner) can't play, our defense is really bad, and defense is the foundation of our life in this league. So we'll take a good look at it. "

This can lead to changes in the squad, but Pritchard has to make a decision on Jocelyn first¡° From the chief assistant of a championship team to the head coach of a team, you never know what reaction will take place, "Pritchard said of Jocelyn." but the 12 inch distance is also very large. It's like from the general manager to the president. You can say that you are ready, but the pressure you face is quite different. At the same time, you need to take on new responsibilities, which is also a challenge. Every coach needs to go through this process, and what I like about Nate is that he is good at self reflection and hopes to become an excellent coach in the future
