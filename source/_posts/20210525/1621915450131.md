On May 25, the NBA officially announced the winner of the best sixth man in the regular season 2020-21. Utah Jazz guard Jordan Clarkson beat Joe ingers and Derek Ross to win the best sixth man in his career.

"It's crazy for me." In an interview with TNT's inside the NBA, Clarkson said, "in the first few years, because I played in Los Angeles, I was just trying to find myself, trying to find the influence I could bring in this sport and what I could bring to it. When I play this role, I will accept it and try to do it. This situation has been strengthened since the Cleveland Cavaliers traded to Utah Jazz, because everyone has to know their role and what they are doing

"I took it (the sixth person role) and made it a part of it, and then moved on." Clarkson continued.

It is worth mentioning that, as Clarkson and ingers were shortlisted for the award, TNT asked ingers to present the award to his teammates. Host Ernie Johnson asked them how many jazz players had won the award before. Clarkson replied zero, and knowing the result, ingers raised his index finger, then grabbed the trophy and handed it to the shocked Clarkson.

"Thank you for passing the ball to me, man." Clarkson said with a smile.

"He stole the award from me and I should avoid passing it to him in the future." Engels said jokingly.

"I pass as many passes as I can so that he can be the sixth man of the year," ingers continued. "I think he deserves and is proud of his influence on the bench. I think sometimes when players are on the bench, I'm not sure about their role, or whether they're ignored, etc. But you have to accept that, plus his influence, the data says it all. "

However, Clarkson also expressed his bigger goal, "we want to pursue something else (Championship), we have a further goal, this is what we want." Clarkson concluded.
