On May 25, warriors player Andrew Wiggins updated his social media and revealed a picture of himself wearing the uniform of the Canadian national team, with the following words: "Canada national team 2021!" Hinted that he will join the Canadian national team in this summer's game.

Curry, a teammate of the warriors, commented: "go!" Teammate Pascal also made a message: "wow ~"

If Wiggins really join the Canadian national team, it is a good supplement for coach Nick NASS. The advantage of the Canadian team lies in the guard. If Wiggins joins, it will give them more depth of attack. In the case of Murray unable to play due to injury, the Canadian team needs his scoring ability very much.
