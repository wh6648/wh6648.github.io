[comprehensive evaluation]

advantage:

At least at the university level, he is definitely a star player and an elite high-yield defender. Last season, he was shortlisted for the John Wooden award and won the Bob cusy Award for the best point guard of the year. On the court, duo sunmu is a leader with a great overall view. In his junior season, he has been able to send 5.3 assists per game. He has a good ability of starting speed in the first step. Besides scoring and organizing, he is also an excellent rebounder and an all-round backcourt exporter. In his junior season, he has won three doubles twice.

Duo sunmu is also a very hard-working player, which can be seen from his three-point shooting rate in the University. To junior season, he has been able to cast 39% of the outside line efficiency, but also developed a step back three skills package. Duo sunmu is a player born for the big scene. He hit the key ball many times during his college years. In the aspect of breaking through the end, duo sunmu has a rich skill package. He has the ability of violent dunk and can finish all kinds of difficult layups after confrontation. In the junior season, he can still keep 50% of the shooting rate when he makes 15 shots every time, which shows that he is a player with reasonable attack choice, which is also reflected in pick and roll attack and other aspects.

Of course, when the team's attack stalled and needed some heroism, dosun Mu could also take the initiative to stop and kill. Last season, he could make five free throws per game. In addition, duosunmu's defense is improving every year, and the average game is always maintained at the level of one steals.

Disadvantages:

However, as a core point guard, duo sunmu also has some defects. First of all, he is a big guard, and his athletic talent is not the best in his class. In addition, during his college years, he had a very high round share, and his ability of assists needed to be improved, with an average of 3.3 errors per game. The low ratio of assists errors undoubtedly lowered people's expectations of him. Duo sunmu's starting speed is very fast, but the speed is often not easy to maintain, the ability to cross the half court attack is not enough.

In addition, as a No. 1 player, his three-year free throw hit rate was only 75%, and it increased to 78% in his junior year, but it was still not up to the standard. As a third grader, duo sunmu is 21 years old. Compared with many guards of the same level who are only 19 years old and younger, he has no advantage in potential. After entering the NBA in the future, it may become a forced option to increase weight and play No. 2.

In the end, after several weighing, duosunmu stayed in his hometown and chose to enter the University of Illinois.

It can be said that from the first day of entering the University, duo sunmu was the absolute core and star of the team.

There are not many NBA players produced by the University of Illinois. In history, the most famous characters are the former jazz and the net master Deron Williams. There are only two NBA active players from the University of Illinois. They are Meyers Leonard and Kendrick Nunn. The latter entered the league as a draft loser. Since Leonard was chosen by the pioneers in the 11th place in the first round in 2012, the players from the University of Illinois have been ignored in the draft for eight consecutive years. But this year, dosun Mu is expected to break the embarrassing record.
