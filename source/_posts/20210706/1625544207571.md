The Milwaukee Bucks eliminated the Atlanta Hawks 4-2 in the Eastern Conference finals and joined the Phoenix Suns in the finals. The journey was very difficult: the big leader of the G4 bucks was defeated by the eagles after his left knee was stretched out; Referring to the two years' humiliating history of the Bucks, it seems that the balance of victory has fallen to the eagle's side. However, the Bucks played more smoothly in attack and defense, and even eliminated the hawks with a wave of two wins in a row. As the saying goes, "it's not terrible to win, it's embarrassing to lack someone". The double MVP letter brother was embarrassed from the appearance.

In fact, this is not entirely the problem of the letter brother, because the Bucks took out his magic weapon - unlimited defense. How does unlimited defense change save the bucks? Let me tell you something about the Bucks this season.

In the first two seasons, the bucks are dragon in the regular season and worm in the playoffs, which is related to the team's offensive and defensive system. Bucks play fast attack with letter brother breakthrough as the core, blindly push fast rhythm, drive crazy scoring with high number of returns and high number of shots, scoring area is magic ball, concentrated in the restricted area and three-point area. At the defensive end, the Bucks adopt the squatting defense, center Lopez shrinks the basket, sweeps inside and outside, defends the strong side with high pressure, and empties the weak side with three points properly, which makes the bucks a team with poor three points. There are problems at both ends of attack and defense in the playoffs: brother letterman's technique is rough, he relies on strong and sudden attacks, can't fight positional warfare, and is strangled by the combination of internal and external opponents; Bradso, the third leader, dropped the chain every day, Middleton, the second leader, showed instability and the whole team's attack was poor; The defenders of the opponents pick and roll the crouching Lopez, or pass to the weak side for three points, so the Bucks break down at both ends of attack and defense.

This season saw off bradso and George Hill, in exchange for huoledi and tucker. These two new players completely changed the temperament of the Bucks, made the team strong, and improved the team's offensive and defensive level.

Huo ledi became the most important player of the team, responsible for the control of the field. Brother and Middleton were also responsible for holding the ball. The increase of players makes the team more flexible in attack. However, the team lacks top field controllers, and the attack system is still single, relying on singles and fast attack, and playing a small amount of pick and roll (similar to Boston Celtic). The letter brother has increased the work of auxiliary attack and positional attack, such as making cover and air cutting, improving the level of back body singles, basket picking and hook, plus his good sudden points and counter attack fast attack, which constitute the basic points of the team. The Bucks reduced their speed and played positional warfare to enrich the team's attack. However, the lack of field controllers made the team's attack space a little "constipated", and the three-point shooting rate was not as good as last season (there were also reasons for the excessive consumption of defensive end); Because Huo ledi joined the club and took on a lot of dirty work, Middleton recovered. Both of them were able to name their opponents by pick and roll. At the critical moment, MI and Huo held up the offensive flag.

Bucks in the defensive end changes more, the conventional moment still uses the letter brother and Lopez as the core of the squat defense, with the joining of huoledi and Tucker, increased the proportion of unlimited defense (especially the critical moment), in order to ensure the defense rate and continuity, can better pinch the opponent's pick and roll attack or weak side three points. The bucks are good at fighting back and attacking fast.

The Bucks often put up the five small lineup with the letter brother as the center at the critical moment, with the partners of huoledi, Middleton and tucker. They have strong mobility and fast speed. They can not only output firepower at the offensive end, but also have good naming space. The letter brother can also eat the opponent with his back in the low position. The defensive end adopts unlimited defense exchange to suppress the opponent and avoid the trouble of squatting defense.

Bucks opponent eagle is a young guards, the offensive end by three axes - pick and roll, roll call and early attack. There are many players in the team, such as Trey young, Bogdan and Luwei, as well as Capella and Collins. There are also shooters such as Gallinari and Holt. The dribbler punishes the opponent's slow-moving interior line with pick and roll, or creates scoring opportunities for the "wall" and shooters. Trey young has top scoring ability, first-class passing vision, and pocket passing is unique. The eagles are very good at early attack, which is a routine between fast attack and positional attack. It is used by the eagles in the playoffs when the opponent's foothold is not stable (the defensive position is not reached or the defensive formation is not closed). The New York Knicks in the first round and the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round are the top defensive teams. However, they often face a wave of early attack and three-point rain before the defensive formation is completed. They can only look forward and sigh, and are unable to fight back and are eliminated. The Hawks are short of defensive resources. There are only a few defensive resources such as Capella, redish and hunt. Yang and Luwei may be named. Therefore, the team adds a lot of regional defense (such as 2-3 defense or box one) to make up for the defects. However, the Hawks can not solve the problem in defense. When the team is in trouble, coach McMillan will strengthen the offensive touch.

The Bucks showed better attack and defense qualities than the Knicks and Philadelphia when facing the eagles. In G1 bucks, the ball holder headed by Yang punished the Bucks' squatting defense with three axes and won the game; In G2, the Bucks reversed the situation, it gave the eagles slow down, confrontation and strength, Huo ledi like a vine to the eagles Trey - Yang and other holding points of the application of iron defense, team-mates cut off Yang's pass route; The team uses moves such as online attack, internal attack and unlimited defense exchange to interfere with Yang's scoring and passing by height and mobility. When Yang calls the roll, the team uses squeeze screen to reduce the harm of the roll call. After defending the next attack, the team quickly changed the attack and caught the Hawks off guard.

The eagles' regional joint defense, one inside and one out, may have a restrictive effect on the Letterman of the first two seasons. However, this season's Letterman has evolved, and can use 18 kinds of martial arts to cut opportunity points, such as sudden points, down and air cutting, back jump shot, hook, pick basket and push fast attack, slashing 26.5 points + 10 boards + 5.5 assists. Middleton and Holliday called the Hawks back line by pick and roll, supplemented by three break-up projection of Connaughton, Lopez and Forbes, and generally implemented the principle of "fast attack and slow defense". The Bucks won two games in a row to show their dominance, and the G2 froze Trey young to get only 15 points (37.5% from the field and 12.5% from the three-point field). In G4, due to Yang's absence, McMillan put Luwei in the starting line-up. Two players, Luwei and Bogdan, named big Lopez alternately and took the lead; Bucks in the second half to find the state, close the score; Unexpectedly, a bolt from the blue letter brother suddenly injured, Bucks all collapse, the final fiasco.

When the fans predicted that the Bucks would repeat the mistakes of the previous two seasons and be sent back to their hometown by the eagles after losing the chain, budenhorse made a big move - Unlimited Defense change, which became the turning point of the whole series.

The most interesting part of this unlimited defense change is that the big Lopez and Portis are the centers to carry out unlimited defense change. This is the "piracy" of the small five with brother Letterman as the center, but it has achieved amazing results. Portis can change his defense naturally, but Lopez, a heavy center, also takes part in the outward expansion defense and changes his guard. He bravely faces the roll call of Dewey, Bogdan and Trey young, instead of shrinking and squatting in the previous few games. In the battle of Tianwang mountain, Luwei and Bogdan were unable to defend themselves. They lacked enough firepower to deal with it; G6 Trey young forced to return, but due to the impact of injury moving speed, can not do punishment is useless.

What's more, the letter brother, who has no range and is not conducive to offensive space, won't be on the court. Most of the players on the court have range, but the offensive space has been optimized, and the ball has been running smoothly. Middleton's call to the Hawks' back line has been full of flowers. The Hawks can only enhance the offensive to fight a hand, so it also reduced Capella time, reuse Gallinari, little effect, but let the team defense collapse, big Lopez therefore can inside and outside, whatever you want, played the "rebound history scoring king and blocking king" level.
