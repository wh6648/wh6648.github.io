July 6 news, from the beginning of the regular season, schedule problems affect the teams, because it is October after the finals last year, the finals of the Lakers and heat only get less than a month's rest time, they were forced to enter the new season training camp. In order to give consideration to the audience rating and stagger the time of the Olympic Games, the official arranged to play 72 regular season games in less than six months. This high-intensity and intensive schedule has also become the root cause of many players' injuries. One of the most outspoken critics is the Laker superstar LeBron James, who has published a series of articles on social media, accusing officials of neglecting players' health for business interests. Today, Chris Paul, chairman of NBA players union, responded to the issue of tight schedule on media day of NBA finals.

Paul did not respond directly to James' comments, but made it clear that when the players' Union makes decisions for more than 400 members, each player can let his voice be heard.

"Man, one thing is certain about our league and our players is that everything can be talked about," Paul said on the media day of the finals. "As we communicate, there are a lot of people on the executive committee working hard - day after day. I want you to know what's going on, so it's a decision to play or not and the players are always involved

"Injuries are always unfortunate. You hate injuries. But just like when we went to the park for the second round, everything was discussed, including the physical condition of the players. It may not be the same for one player, it may not be the same for another, but everything has been discussed and will continue to be so. So if someone doesn't like it, then you need to know that everyone has the same chance to be part of all these conversations. " Paul continued.

Injuries also "patronize" the Bucks, letter brother adtokumbo missed the last two games of the Eastern Conference finals due to excessive extension of his left knee, whether he can play the first game of the finals is still unknown, but in the sun coach Monty Williams's view, the bucks without letter brother are still difficult to deal with.

"The pressure they (bucks) put on the inside has always been very stable, even in the absence of brother Letterman, you will see the impact of Zhu huoledi and Brooke Lopez, which is something we have to respect. When Letterman hits the inside line, you have to respect them, whether it's conversion or singles, especially his and Middleton's pick and roll. So when Letterman is absent, they seem to have other ways of hitting the box, and then they all go for rebounds. So they didn't stop playing the way they wanted to. In the playoffs, the pressure on the inside has been very stable Monty Williams said.

Suns center Andrew Aton said he was preparing for the finals as if he would be back on the court at some point in the series.

"The main thing is to match his physical strength. You can't shrink from the challenge. I know about his foul. As the first defender, I want to set up a defensive wall for him and stay between him and the ball... It's just to prepare for the challenge. " Aton said.
