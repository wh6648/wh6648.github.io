July 6 news, after 16 years, Chris Paul finally entered the NBA Finals, he is only four wins away from lifting the Larry O'Brien cup. If the superstar felt the pressure of standing in the middle of the stage, however, he did not show it at today's press conference before the finals. Talking about the upcoming experience of the first finals, Paul humorously said that this time he can't be an idle person and watch the game at home. This feeling is very strange.

When asked by reporters how it felt to reach the finals for the first time in his career, Paul said: "it's very strange. Why didn't you watch the game. I used to watch games. So being unable to watch the game right now is probably the worst. But I'd rather stay on the court and play

In fact, Paul has been contributing his strength on the court. Although he suffered shoulder injury in the first round of the playoffs against the Los Angeles Lakers and was suspended due to the health and safety agreement, the veteran averaged 18.1 points, 8.7 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 1.4 steals in his 14 games. Now Paul has a new responsibility.

"You have to always remember that it's a blessing and an opportunity, but it's still a basketball game, and I think our team knows when to target, when to enjoy the moment and enjoy themselves." Said Paul.

"I definitely want to play. I don't want to be absent. It's strange to be absent," Paul said of his torn ligament

In addition, Paul also talked about the finals opponent bucks, "Zhu - huoledi is the perfect team player, and PJ - Tucker is an important part of their team." Paul said.
