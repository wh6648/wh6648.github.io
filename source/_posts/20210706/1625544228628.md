On July 6, it was reported that Dennis Schroeder hoped to represent Germany in the Tokyo Olympic Games. In the weeks before that, he would become a much anticipated free agent. Last month, Schroeder said in an interview that he hoped to sign a contract worth $100 million to $120 million this summer, but the German men's basketball team was unable to pay the corresponding huge insurance, resulting in Schroeder's absence from the Olympic Games.

Schroeder said in an interview with the times today that he hopes to play in this year's Olympic Games¡° If it's possible, it's good... I'm on call, but my situation is not so easy to solve. I hope we've settled the contract at the start of the Olympics and my agent has to work now. The German national team has finished the work, let's wait and see Schroeder said.

Because of the epidemic, German men's basketball team was very short of funds and initially provided Schroeder with us $10 million insurance, but Schroeder was not satisfied. Obviously, Schroeder has changed his mind now. If an agreement is reached, he can only join the team as a substitute. Schroeder has been representing the German national team in various international competitions since he was a teenager. He was the top scorer in European basketball 2017 (23.7 points per game). The German men's basketball team did not have Schroeder's name in the Olympic Games List previously released, but if there are problems such as player injury, Schroeder can enter the national team through player replacement.
