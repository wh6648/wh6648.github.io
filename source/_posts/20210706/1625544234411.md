July 6 news, there is no doubt that the Brooklyn nets is one of the most popular teams to win the championship this season, and the reason is very good, even before James Harden joined, they had the league's most impressive Duo - Carey Owen and Kevin Durant. Unfortunately, injuries hindered the pace of the nets forward, with the early departure of the season, some news has also been burst out. According to Matt Sullivan, the nets superstars even broke the League health agreement by holding a secret training camp in Kobe's old stadium.

"They held a secret training camp in Kobe's old Gymnasium... James Harden went to that gymnasium after he joined Brooklyn. All these strict rules, when you are wearing masks and gloves and are not allowed to touch basketball, they have been conducting secret training, trying to make Durant and Owen recover." Matt Sullivan reports.

It's not up to us to decide whether this is true or not. The NBA will investigate it in depth. If the League finds that the nets do violate the health and safety agreement, players and teams will be punished more severely by the league.
