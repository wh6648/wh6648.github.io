On July 6, reports from the US media said that the Hawks general manager Travis shurenke said in an interview today that one of the main jobs of the team in the off-season is to try to keep John Collins.

In the 2017 draft, the eagles selected Collins in the 19th place in the first round. After the end of this season, Collins rookie contract officially expired. Off season, he became a restricted free agent.

It can be expected that Collins's team is looking for a big contract. In December 2020, Collins rejected an early contract extension from the eagles for more than $90 million. According to previous rumors, Collins hopes to get a top salary.

"I told Collins yesterday that he was proud of the way he played this year," schulenck said. "Last fall he decided to enter the restricted free agent market. A lot of times, it affects the players

"But you can see from Collins that he's not fighting for data, he's there to play for the team and help the team win," schulenck continued. "A lot of times when players enter the free agent market, you see the opposite."

"We didn't see that in Collins this year, I think it reflects his character and what he did," schulenk said. "He always cares about the team winning, and I don't have any negative comments on him."

Collins has made a positive contribution to the eagles' ability to reach the Eastern Conference finals this year.
