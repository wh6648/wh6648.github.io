Owen's frequent absence from the game is only due to his family affairs, which is totally excusable. In fact, Owen has indeed played a historical level of offensive efficiency this season, and the cooperation between him and harden has become more and more tacit. This is the most difficult thing. On March 30, 2021, the Nets beat the Timberwolves 112-107 and Owen scored 27 points and 7 rebounds.

After the opening, although Owen didn't make a move, he sent assists in a row. This season, Owen averaged 5.7 assists per game. It's very good to send such assists at harden's side. In the nine minutes of the first quarter, Owen even made a false move to shake his wrist in the baseline service, which directly assisted Harris to hit the three-point shot. However, the Timberwolves as the League defense penultimate team, want to defend the net, it is really difficult.

Or is there anyone who can defend Owen's single now? Eight minutes in the first quarter, Owen drove straight in and made a European fake layup. Then Owen, this time changed to the right side after the breakthrough stop jump shot, dislocation hit a surprise Downes. After that, Owen was even more reluctant. First, he received harden's pass to lay up 2 + 1, then Owen opened the invincible mode, and in 26 seconds, he hit two three points in a row.

In the first quarter of 4:08, Owen changed to the top arc this time, which was another quasi three points. In a few minutes, Owen hit six goals in a row, and even shot 15 points to open the gap. The whole first quarter was Owen's attacking moment. However, after the start of the second quarter, Owen fell into the doldrums, or gave up the offensive power. In the third quarter, the Timberwolves once caught up with 4 points. At this time, Owen finally showed his sword and helped the team stop bleeding with a winning throw.

In the last five minutes of the last quarter, the Timberwolves chased for points again. At this time, Owen received a pass from harden and finished a layup in the interior like a ballet. This layup basically announced the end of the game, and the nets had firmly taken the initiative at this time. The last two minutes of the game or Owen, in the left shot a stop jump shot, is again in the key node of the ball.. Although Owen once lost a three-point shot in the last minute of the game, his flaws did not hide his weaknesses. Owen grabbed the key rebound in the last 8 seconds and made a steady free throw to kill the game. This game Owen's comeback has played the very good performance and the attack efficiency, finally defeats the forest wolf to continue to win in succession.
