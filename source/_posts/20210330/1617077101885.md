March 30 news: at today's press conference, Rafael stone, general manager of Houston Rockets, reviewed the operation of the team this season. Speaking of the James Harden deal in January, Stone said he did not regret it and would still make that deal 100% if he did it again.

In this blockbuster deal, the Rockets won Victor oradibo, but the latter was proved not to be the team's most suitable candidate, and was eventually traded to the Miami Heat. Nevertheless, in Houston's view, the biggest motive for the deal is to get the historic four future first round draft rights and other draft rights swap rights. That's why Stone said that even if the team's performance is unsatisfactory now, he is still confident of the team's return.

When asked by ESPN reporter Tim Macmahon about the deal, Stone said: "the day after the deal, one of your colleagues sent me a text message saying they would evaluate my deal in 2027. I told them it was too early and they should come back in 2030 to do the assessment. I think we thought we were doing the best deal for the team. Obviously, it's my job, so I did. Especially considering the things we get, yes, it feels like you may not know how to do it in these years - for example, three years, five years, maybe so. But I feel good. "

"I'm 100% sure I'll do that deal again. Again, you don't know all the advantages as well as I do, but I don't regret that deal at all. I've never doubted that." Stone continued, "I've said a lot about being in a position that might not have to be [rebuilt], and we've done other things. But it's mainly the deal that allows us to say, "Hey, we want to compete in a faster time frame. We won't go that way - deliberately losing games for years in a row

Of course, the Rockets don't want to trade harden at all. They prefer to focus on the perennial all star and MVP leader and continue to strive for the championship. But harden thought his peak might be coming to an end, so he told the Rockets management that he wanted a deal and a better chance to compete for the championship. Stone also thinks the deal is a better result for the team because they don't want harden to leave as a free agent in 2022. Although harden left, the Rockets also ushered in a honeymoon period, hit a wave of six consecutive wins, but then suffered a wave of record 20 consecutive losses. Still, the Rockets chose the deal not just for the 2020-21 season.

In addition, stone also talked about the oradipo deal. "We made a very promising deal - that is, Victor (oradipo) is not our best choice, so what would you do at that time? Then, it will become another favorable deal and enter into the next stage. We really like the players we've got in this deal. We've loved Kelly olinik and Avery Bradley for many years. Then, we also made room for a starting position to give other players opportunities and playing time, especially Kevin Porter, which is very important Said stone.

"We have a young core team, we like our bets, we think we've seen their progress, obviously, we'll bring in our core team, but I don't think we need to mess up." Stone said.
