March 30 news, reports from the U.S. media said that informed sources revealed that after officially joining the Lakers, Andre Drummond is expected to replace mark Gasol as the starting center of Zijin team.

The source said that because there are many inside players in the Laker team, Zhuang Shen's playing time in the team may be less than 28.9 minutes in the Cavaliers this season. Also, he is unlikely to get too many singles opportunities.

In other words, Zhuang Shen's role in the Laker team is to protect the basket, protect the basket, and become a shield and the end point in the offensive end. It is reported that Zhuangshen can be regarded as an enlarged version of Monterey Harrell.

After Zhuang Shen came to Zijin team, Gasol was very embarrassed. This week he turned down an interview arranged for him by the team, not the first time the Spanish tower has refused to be interviewed this season.

But it's worth mentioning that this interview was refused after the Lakers officially announced the signing of Zhuang Shen. So will the Lakers fire Pau Gasol? There's news that the Lakers may not.

After joining the Lakers this season, little Gasol's overall performance was lower than expected. In his 38 games, he averaged 19.8 minutes, 4.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 blocks.
