This season, the Los Angeles Lakers built a "double giant, double Super Six" luxury warship, shaking the league; unexpectedly, the road is rough, first, because of a large-scale truce with tendinitis; after that, James suffered Solomon hill "rolling mine" attack, injured and absent. The Laker has fallen into the most difficult period of the season, led by Schroeder and Harrell, with a poor record. When they meet strong teams, they are always "proud even if they lose", and can only defeat weak teams such as Cavaliers and magic. James's absence makes the team lack a tactical initiator and court controller. Schroeder, Caruso and Tucker's passing vision and game reading ability are not enough to connect the whole team (the Lakers should miss Rondo's guidance). However, the absence of thick eyebrows makes the team lack interior attackers and basket defenders. Although "old cold leg" little Gasol has good coordination ability, However, he was inevitably named by the opponent's guards and couldn't protect the rebounds (Gasol's rebounds were also criticized in his youth peak period); Harrell was first-class in attack under the basket, but was afraid of a tall center due to his height and poor defense; Morris could only shoot, and defense was the loophole level. All in all, rebounds are in a hurry, and inside lines are in a hurry. It's not urgent. If the Lakers are in trouble, Chuang Shen will help.

Zhuang Shen (Andrea Drummond) has the top static talent, 2.08m in height, 2.29M in arm span, 2.78m in standing touch height, and 127kg in weight. He also has the athletic talent. When he first entered the league, his speed and speed were good (he once participated in the slam dunk competition), but now he has a serious decline (it may be related to his attitude). Unfortunately, for a long time, he has mixed with the weak teams (Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers) and has not formed a good habit of winning. He has a lazy attitude and is unstable in attack and defense. He plays tricks all year round.

Zhuang Shen is lack of technical talent. His attack means are catching the ball to eat the cake and grabbing the board to make up the basket. His independent attack is very common. His scoring means rely on the low hook, layup, air cutting and dunk. His shooting range is short and his shooting is poor (the jump shot hit rate is 35.2%, not dare to use it). However, Zhuang Shen has the rebounding ability of historical level. He has won two all stars and four rebounding Kings (average rebounds in four seasons are more than 14). He also has 13.5 rebounds this season. He has the top rebounding sense and awareness of rebounding. He and Kevin Lefu, the rebounding brush of historical level, join the Cavaliers and still win the rebounding King (after Zhuang Shen joined the Cavaliers, Lefu's rebounds dropped to 9.8); Different from many rebounding brushes who are good at grabbing the backboard, he also has good second take-off ability and is good at grabbing the front court board. Up to now, he has 4.7 front court boards in his career. Zhuang Shen's basketball IQ is fair. He has the level of coordination that can be used. He can pass the ball in the penalty area and elbow area (3.0 assists per game in 18 seasons). However, Reggie Jackson and Griffin were in the piston period, so his coordination can't be used. Zhuang Shen has excellent ability to steal (1.98 per game in 20 seasons), which is not in line with his position as center, which is closely related to his ability to predict. The result of Zhuang Shen's bad team is the poor defensive attitude and consciousness. The basket protection is generally mediocre. This season, he has a slight recovery (the basket protection can reduce the opponent's hit rate as high as 7.8%), but the defense change and pick and roll prevention are still not good.

For the Laker, Zhuang Shen can provide much-needed things, the first thing is the rebounds: Little Gasol, Harrell and big Morris control the unstable rebounds, give the opponent too many front boards, also can't effectively promote the defensive counterattack, so the role of the historical level rebounding beast in stabilizing the situation is beyond doubt. Zhuang Shen also has the ability to take off two times to grab the front board and make up for the basket. He has made up for the basket 33 times this season (with a shooting rate of 54.5%).

The second is to eat cakes. Little Morris and little Gasol fly kites on the outside line (little Gasol can occasionally play a few low positions). Harrell has the best ability to eat cakes. However, due to his height, he often gets shriveled when he meets a tall center. Zhuang Shen, who is taller, can eat cakes and cut points. The Lakers are a team that focuses on positional warfare (99.2 rounds per game, 17th in the League). They attach importance to scoring on the inside (51.6, 6th in the League) and attacking on the second (13.4, 10th in the League). Zhuang Shen's technical characteristics can just be used.

The third is protecting the basket. This season, Zhuang Shen's protecting the basket has warmed up. The Lakers' Harrell and big Mo are poor in protecting the basket, and little Gasol is in serious decline. Zhuang Shen can come in handy. However, Zhuangshen lacks the ability to change defense and prevent pick and roll, which depends on the transformation of coach Vogel. Last season, big Mo was a defensive failure. Under the guidance of Vogel, he relied on big delay and back defense to prevent pick and roll, and the effect was better than that of McKee and Howard, which is also the reason why he got more playing time in the playoffs. Zhuang Shen is young and can move fast. After strengthening his defensive attitude and consciousness, he should be able to achieve the effect of big mo. Zhuang Shen's coordination and snatching ability can be used. All in all, the arrival of Zhuang Shen solved the urgent need of the Lakers and helped them to get through the difficult period without Zhan and eyebrow.

However, the limitation of Zhuang Shen is still the ability of independent attack and projection, which may restrict the offensive space of the Lakers; it is unknown whether Vogel's development of Zhuang Shen's defense is effective. With James and the gods of thick eyebrow returning, the inside of the Lakers have thick eyebrow, little Gasol, Harrell, Zhuang Shen and big Morris, and the platoon arrangement of the five inside has become the "happy trouble" of the Lakers.

In order to ensure the health of thick eyebrow, Vogel arranges his regular time to play power forward (accounting for 88%) and critical time to play center (accounting for 12%). Therefore, the internal configuration of the Lakers is often double tower and single internal (single tower) alternate configuration. The main interior lines that the Lakers are suitable for the single tower are Nongmei and Harrell (last season's playoffs, Vogel once let big Mo play the single tower and set up a fast lineup, which caught the Houston Rockets by surprise). Zhuang Shen can also be a single tower, cooperating with the three guards of the Lakers + Kuzma, but he is lack of independent attack and projection ability. As a single tower, he can only protect the basket and eat cakes, which has obvious defects.

The configuration of two towers is also worth studying. The successful twin towers in history can be divided into three structures: one is the "two spirits" configuration, both of which have projection ability, flexible position, and can pull space (such as Duncan and Robinson's Spurs twin towers, Randolph's little Gasol's Grizzlies twin towers); the other is the "one spirit and one strength" configuration, one Tara space, and the other tower can attack the basket (such as the Lakers' Gasol and Bynum twin towers); the other is the "one spirit and one strength" configuration, one Tara space, and the other tower can attack the basket (such as the Lakers' Gasol and Bynum twin towers); One is the "one defense and one defense" configuration, one Tara space, one tower basket defense (such as the Spurs' Duncan and Elson / Oberto twin towers) (editor's note: two top configuration or one defense twin tower is difficult to succeed). Thick eyebrow is a typical flexible projection interior line. His twin towers with Mo / Gasol are "two spirits" configuration, which can be exchanged inside and outside seamlessly. His partner with Harrell is "one spirit and one strong", and his partner with Zhuang Shen is "one spirit and one defense". Thick eyebrow has to withdraw to the central position to provide space for Harrell and Zhuang Shen to attack the basket. Zhuang Shen, as a partial defensive inside without range, can't partner with Harrell who doesn't have the same range. He belongs to "one spirit and one defense" with other inside partners. He can only stand in the inside to grab the board or cut the points.
