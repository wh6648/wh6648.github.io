Houston Rockets guard John wall has had the most challenging season of his career in the 2020-21 season.

After more than a year's injury absence, wall joined the Rockets. It's a new start for wall and he's eager to prove that he's still one of the best defenders in the league. However, in the end, the Rockets (and Timberwolves) became the league's first team to be officially eliminated from the playoffs this season. At present, the Rockets are 15-46, with the worst record in the league, losing nine of the last 10 games. Wall admitted his team had bad luck and vowed to prove the doubters wrong, according to Houston Chronicle reporter Jonathan Fagan.

"I read all the doubters and fans," said wall. "They said I didn't do anything, or the team was nothing. We know it's not the season we want, but we have to deal with a lot of injuries. We are rebuilding a new team and trying to find a way forward. I'm very confident about that and I know we'll have a better performance next year

As far as wall himself is concerned, his various data are still very considerable. In 40 games, he can contribute 20.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists and 1.1 steals, with a shooting percentage of 40.4% and a three-point shooting percentage of 31.7%. However, some pundits no longer list wall as the league's best player.

"I still think of myself as an all star player in the league. I still think of myself as a top player in the league. In the past two years, many talented players have entered the league. Before I was injured, there were a lot of talented players in the league. But I feel that when I am healthy, I can compete with the best players Wall said.
