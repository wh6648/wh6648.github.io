April 26 news, reports from the U.S. media, informed sources revealed that the Lakers plan to start off-season contract renewal negotiations with Frank Vogel.

The source said that the management of the Laker team recognized Vogel's coaching style and was satisfied with the results he led the team and the role he played in the dressing room.

Off season in 2019, the Lakers officially signed Vogel, when the two sides signed a three-year contract. In the 19-20 season, the Lakers won the Disney closed Park title.

At present, Vogel is in the second year of his contract. In LeBron James and Anthony Davis two superstars accumulated absence of 54 games, the Lakers still maintain the league's first defensive efficiency. Vogel contributed a lot to this.

At this stage, the goal of the Lakers is still to achieve good results this season.
