May 22 news, from the NBA reporter Brian - wenhorst reported that informed sources revealed that the NBA is likely to retain the playoff system.

The current playoff system is that in the regular season, the seventh and eighth teams in the eastern and Western departments compete with each other. The winning team becomes the seventh seed in the eastern and Western departments and plays the second seed in the first round of the playoffs. The losers will meet the 9th and 10th winners in the East and West for the final playoff seat.

This week's playoff between the Lakers and the warriors saw an average of 5.6 million viewers across the United States. This time, it was the highest single media average after the G4 finals in the Western Conference in 2019. According to ESPN broadcasters, the average ratings of the Lakers and warriors were 5618000, up 190% from last year's playoffs.

Since the outbreak, the league has launched the playoff system in 2020, which has increased the suspense of the playoffs. Before that, they were all in the first eight of the regular season to advance directly to the playoffs. And now the 9th and 10th of the East and West departments have the possibility to impact the playoffs in theory, which greatly increases the appreciation of the closing stage of the regular season. However, it should be pointed out that from next season, the League will return to normal work and rest, and it is very likely to return to 82 games in the regular season.

Before that, the superstar LeBron James of the Laker team attacked the playoff system, which caused extensive discussion in the media and fans. In the view of some media people, the most favorable point for the league is to increase the audience rating. But for the players in the playoffs, their consumption will increase.
