LeBron James has achieved some amazing successes with the Los Angeles Lakers in the past three seasons, leading them to win the NBA championship in 2020 and giving them a chance to win the championship again in 2021. But reporter Lisa Robinson revealed that when James left the Cavaliers again in the summer of 2018 and signed with the Lakers, he seriously considered playing with the New York Knicks.

"We heard that LeBron wanted to go to New York. I have a very reliable source. He seriously considered coming to New York at that time, but his wife Savannah wanted to go to Los Angeles and wanted the children to go to school in Los Angeles. " Lisa Robinson was revealed during a podcast of ESPN's Brian wenhorst.

Before signing with the Lakers in 2018, James obviously wanted to go to New York, where he might make the Knicks an immediate champion, but eventually he chose Los Angeles. The Knicks are in one of the best seasons in many years. They have Julius Randall, RJ Barrett and Derek Ross. They have enough talent to succeed in the playoffs.
