On May 22, the NBA officially released the last MVP of the season. In this issue's list, joachi continues to press enbid to the top, while curry ranks No.4.

1. Nicolas Jokic (nuggets, first place last week)

Season average: 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 1.3 steals

This season, Jokic finished 60 double doubles, ranking first in the league. At the end of the regular season, joachi ranked second in the league with 16 triple doubles. The average score and assists of the season set a career high, and the rebounding level set a career high. It is worth mentioning that Jokic won the player of the Month award twice this season.

2. Joel nbid (76ers, 2nd place last week)

Season average: 28.5 points, 10.6 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, 1.0 steals

Does nbid have a chance to be in the best team? In this season's regular season, nbid has a lot of time to lead the MVP list, but the problem is that he missed too many games (21 games) due to injury; And the 76ers found a way to win without the emperor.

3. Janice adtokumbo (bucks, third place last week)

Season average: 28.1 points 11.0 rebounds 5.9 assists 1.2 steals 1.2 blocks

Letterman is the only player in the League to average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 block and 1 steal this season. Maybe the letter brother will get some votes in the MVP election, but it is very difficult for him to be crowned MVP for the third consecutive year. The biggest problem is that the Bucks didn't come first in the East this year.

4. Stephen curry (warriors, 5th place last week)

Season average data: 32.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.2 steals

5. Chris Paul (suns, seventh place last week)

Season average: 16.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.4 steals
