On May 22, famous NBA reporter shams charania revealed the inside story of last year's Los Angeles Clippers star Coway Leonard's recruitment of Sergi Ibaka. It is worth mentioning that Leonard let Ibaka choose to join the clippers with just one text message.

In the 2019-20 season, the clippers were eliminated by nuggets in the Western semi-final with a big score of 3-1. In the off-season, the Clippers started an arms race with the Los Angeles Lakers. Before the signing of the contract, the Lakers dug the wall for the Clippers' inside line Harrell, while the Clippers grabbed Ibaka. Today, the famous reporter shams charania revealed how the Clippers recruited Ibaka.

It was Leonard who recruited Ibaka himself, and he just sent a text message to Ibaka saying, "are you coming or not£¨ Are you coming here or not?)¡±

Finally, Ibaka came to the clippers and signed a two-year contract worth 19 million dollars. This season, Ibaka played 41 games, averaging 11.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.2 blocks.
