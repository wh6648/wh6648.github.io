On May 22, in the latest "all the smoke" podcast, Lin talked with Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson about a variety of topics, including the cooperation with Kobe Bryant in the 2014-15 season. Lin Shuhao revealed that in the 2014-15 season, he had a dispute with Kobe, and neither of them spoke in the last few months of the season. That season, the Lakers only won 21-61 in the regular season, ranking second from the bottom in the West.

"At the time [Kobe] was recovering from injuries, and he had some other injuries as well. Although he will be 35 years old, his mind is like 25 years old. He wants to prove it to the whole world, because all the reporters are saying that he can't recover from a serious Achilles tendon injury... So he said to the reporters, "I want to prove you wrong." Lin recalled.

"There are a lot of games where he has 45 shots a game and he keeps us from shooting. At that time, Kobe went through some serious injuries, his body can't keep up with his requirements... That's why I and others have different views on him Lin continued, "I remember I would go straight to him and say that if we lose, he usually sleeps two or three hours at night and I stay up all night. When we lose, I often watch the video at three or four in the night. We'll text at three or four o'clock, argue with each other, quarrel with each other. "

"I told him," listen, you're Kobe. I'm here to learn from you. If you talk to me like a man and respect me, not like a boy, then I can accept anything. Then, Kobe always said, "everyone said what I wanted them to say, and very few people stood up against me." Lin Shuhao said, "so I'm fed up with this general situation. That's why I rejected him once. Because, you know, I don't want to go back to the way I used to, we have to do something else, the ball has to move. After that text message exchange, we didn't speak in the last four months of the season

Lin's refusal to pass the ball to Kobe occurred in a game between the Lakers and the Clippers when Lin held the ball outside the three-point line and Kobe asked for the ball after falling on the right side. But that time, Lin chose to refuse. He waved to Kobe. Kobe also saw that Lin had no intention of passing, but had to move a few steps to pick and roll for Lin. In the end, Lin scored three points against Paul's defense.
