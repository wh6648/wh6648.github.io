May 22 news, Brooklyn basketball star Kevin Durant today in an interview with the media talked about the first round playoff opponent - Boston Celtic star Jason Tatum.

"The best thing I've seen about JT (Tatum) is that he stays the same no matter how the squad changes. His teammates stop and go, he himself has confirmed a new crown, his partner Jay Brown is not available for the rest of the season, kenba walker is often not available, but he has remained stable Durant said of Tatum.

"I mean, the way he plays, he's never changed his style, from the top of the arc to the low post, to the wing scoring, to now connecting the team through passing. He's only focused on developing and continuing to grow into a better player, which is what I appreciate most about him so far. He is learning more and more about NBA defense. As a young man, he has experienced too much. He's just going to be smarter, and I think people put a lot of things on him, but he's handling it very well Durant continued.

Tatum finished the 202-21 regular season with an amazing performance. In Celtic's last nine games, he scored at least 26 points in eight games, including 60 points against the Spurs and 50 points against the Wizards. This season, Tatum's average score (26.4 points), rebounds (6.6), assists (4.3), shooting percentage (45.9%) have reached a career high.
