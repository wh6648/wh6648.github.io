On May 22, Kevin Durant left the thunder in 2016 to join the 73 win warriors, which shocked the NBA and ruined his reputation. People always feel subconsciously that Durant won the NBA championship only after joining the warriors. Recently, while participating in the podcast of "million dollar worth of game", Durant said that when he signed with the warriors, he thought they were an underdog team.

"The first time I went there, it felt like, 'no, I need to experience it again.' I want to be on that stage again. From the first round of the playoffs in 2012 to the finals, this is the most interesting moment in my basketball career. I just thought, I need to do it again. I don't care who I'm with, but I also want some partners I want. I just need to go through it again. Because I feel more energetic, and I think that's what I should do on earth now - playing. So when I had that experience, I thought, "I'm eager to do it again." Durant said in a podcast.

"I see this is a great team that wants to win, they have an interesting atmosphere, a great city. Oakland is like Washington. It makes me feel like I'm in the southeast. " Durant continued.

"But the organization has never been a successful team. When I was in the league, no one liked the Golden State Warriors. So, for me, it's not a winner. I'm talking about the whole history, not what happened in the past five years. Since the 1950s, the NBA has never had a winning general. So I thought'd * *, it's a bad team for me, it feels good. Like, s * *, this is where I should be. " It's not Los Angeles, it's not New York, but it's where I should be. I think they're going to give me what I want, the feeling of 'damn, we're going to try to win 16 games'. I want to have that feeling again. We've done it three times. I don't want to go anywhere. We may not win, but it's interesting to know that we can be one of the last teams Durant said.

Durant gave many explanations for signing with warriors. He was tired of Oklahoma City Thunder and wanted to live in San Francisco Bay area. At the end of the day, Durant just seems to want people to believe that he didn't take a shortcut to win the championship.
