On May 22, according to a report by the famous NBA reporter Samas chalaniya, a well-informed source revealed that the heat star Jimmy Butler had a very, very fierce dispute with the coaching staff in private.

After chalaniya's exposure, Butler's agent Bernard Lee forwarded the report and responded, "shut your mouth, you're rubbish. No one has told you about it, because it's not true at all. Go to another assistant and report MRI results or other bad news you want to report in the first place. We have a good time here

In the regular season, Butler averaged 33.5 minutes, 21.5 points, 6.9 rebounds and 7.1 assists.
