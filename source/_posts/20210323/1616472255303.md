On March 23, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Cole said today in the "real ones" podcast that he preferred the experience of the 1019-20 season to the 2019 finals loss to the Raptors, even though the warriors were at the bottom of the League last season. Kohl's remarks quickly fermented and aroused heated discussion. This also made Cole very angry. He thought the media was "unfair reporting," and attacked drew schille, a reporter for NBC sports channel, saying that the latter had misinterpreted his remarks.

"My remarks have been completely misinterpreted. This is the most untrue report. It's totally out of context. What I want to say is that we have been on the road to the championship for the last five years. And in 2019, we have great difficulties. We are under a lot of pressure during the 2018-19 season finals. Compared with the previous five years, there was no pressure last season. In this case, we can guide the young players who are eager to grow up. But drew Shiller added fuel to my words by putting this comment on Twitter and then sending it out. It's very irresponsible and destructive. You will feel that this is what I said. " Cole said.

"I'm very angry, I know what's going to happen next, I know it's going to be on the morning show, people talk about it, they're going to use what they think they're quoting, in fact, it's completely fictional. I'm very unhappy. I want to make it very clear: if you want to know the real story, I hope you can watch this podcast completely... Not just from the reporter's Twitter. It's the farthest thing from the truth. It's too unfair. I'm one of the most media friendly coaches, and I'm open to criticism from all sides. But this time I was very angry at me, I was very angry at Shiller's behavior. " Cole continued.

It is worth mentioning that Kevin Durant had previously forwarded Cole's tweet and replied, "this is really funny."

Later, Cole also said that he has always respected Durant very much. "It's ridiculous, you know. We are very grateful for what has happened here over the years. We've had a lot of great moments along the way, great players, and I'm very grateful to Kevin (Durant) for his performance at the warriors. As you all know, he is very good here. We sincerely wish him all the best. That's what we did from the beginning to the end. That's why I'm so angry, because it's all bullshit. " Cole continued.

It is worth mentioning that warriors general manager miles said in an interview in May last year that the team won the championship in 2018 did not bring much happiness. "When we won the championship with Kevin (Durant) for the second time, we felt that we had completed a task, which was good but not happy." Myers said at the time.

Early in the 2018-19 season, Durant and Drummond green also had a fierce quarrel, resulting in the latter being suspended for one match. In February 2020's "all the smoke" podcast, Durant admitted that in the middle of the 2018-19 season, he knew it would be his last season with the warriors.
