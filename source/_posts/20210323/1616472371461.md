On March 23, NBA columnist Zach Lowe reported that informed sources revealed that the warriors are listening to a lot of offers about Kelly ubre.

The source said the warriors didn't have a sense of urgency about trading ubre, so they didn't rush to make a deal. On the other hand, the warriors are also looking forward to seeing the performance of ubre throughout the season.

It has been pointed out that the warriors may be willing to send off ubre in exchange for some assets that can help the team in the future. After all, ubre will be a completely free agent this summer.

Off season last year, the warriors and thunder completed a deal, ubre returned to the bay area. Ubre's current contract was signed in the summer of 2019, when it was a two-year contract with a total value of $30 million.

The warriors, on the other hand, have shown interest in Eagles shooter Bogdan Bogdanovic, according to a tip from the elite journalist Samas chalaniya as the deal deadline approaches.

It is worth mentioning that the clippers, aiming to strengthen the backcourt, are also asking for Bogdanovic.
