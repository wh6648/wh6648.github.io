However, the well-known US gossip media MTO reported today that sources revealed that Kanye West did not believe that their marriage would really end.

"He (Kanye West) understands Kim Kardashian and knows she doesn't want to do it," a source revealed on "Hollywood life." nevertheless, he did it very well. He really didn't believe that Kim Kardashian would end their marriage.

The novel coronavirus pneumonia Kanye West ran for president seemed to be the last straw to be pushed down by Kim Kardashian, but there were also media reports that the two men's marriage began from the beginning of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in early 2020.

"As many of you know, Kanye West has bipolar disorder. Anyone who has had this experience, or who has loved in life, who has had this experience, understands how complex and painful bipolar disorder is. I have never talked publicly about the impact of this incident on our family, because I want to protect our children. When it comes to Kanye West's health, I will protect his privacy. But now, I think I should comment on this because of people's misunderstanding of mental health. " Kim Kardashian said.
