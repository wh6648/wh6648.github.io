On March 22, a well-known source revealed that the superstar LeBron James of the Lakers is suffering from an ankle injury and is expected to be absent for several weeks, according to a report by the famous reporter of the Olympic. ESPN follow-up reports that the Lakers are ready for James to be absent for three weeks, or even a month.

The source said the Lakers are still evaluating James' high ankle sprain. This kind of injury absence time is very variable, and James is not an ordinary player, he has incredible pain tolerance.

Meanwhile, James and the Lakers are wary of the former's return. James won't be back until he gets permission from the team doctor.

"The Lakers are still working out a timeline for James' comeback," the source said. James has shown in his career his incredible ability to recover quickly from injuries, and he has played a lot of games with injuries. This injury is not so easy to recover, so the Lakers will give James enough time

James was injured in the Lakers' home defeat to the Hawks on Sunday when he left with a right ankle injury in the second quarter. After the game, James suffered a high sprain in his right ankle.

James, 36, has played 41 games so far this season, averaging 33.9 minutes, handing in 25.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.9 assists and 1.05 steals.
