On July 25, with the approaching of the 2021 NBA draft date, the Houston Rockets seem to be stepping up their operation. According to the latest report by shams charania, a famous reporter of the atomic, the Rockets are actively trying to trade up and get the top pick of the Detroit Pistons.

In this year's draft conference, the Rockets, who hold the second place sign, aim at the top ranked guard Cade Cunningham of Oklahoma State University. However, if Houston's plan to trade the top ranked player is not realized, they will also explore all options.

"According to NBA insiders, the Rockets are chasing the No. 1 pick of the pistons." Shams charania reports.

The Rockets have the second place in this year's draft conference. According to previous reports, the Rockets will start negotiations with the pistons on the possibility of getting the first place in the upward transaction. It is unclear whether the two sides have started discussions or made any progress on a possible transaction. But it is clear that Houston is keen to add Cade corningham to their young team.

However, Cade corningham has not communicated with the Rockets yet. The 19-year-old young organization core only visited Detroit. In an interview, Cade corningham showed kindness to the pistons and said frankly that he would be very happy if the pistons chose him first. At the same time, he also said he only wanted to meet the first signing team.

At present, Cade corningham ranks first in the odds of the first prize show, and Jay green and Evan Mobley rank second and third. According to reports, the Rockets prefer Jay green because he can partner better with little Kevin Potter in the backcourt.
