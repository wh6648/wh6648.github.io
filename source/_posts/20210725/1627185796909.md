On July 25, according to a report from Jake Fisher, a reporter from the bleachers, informed sources revealed that Bradley bill, the Wizards' home guard, was considering applying for a deal before the draft next Friday (July 30).

The source said Bill knew he had to make a decision before the draft¡° Because it can maximize the interests of both players and teams, "the source said." when you know the draft rights, such a transaction will be easier than the future draft rights. "

It is reported that once bill really applies for a deal, he just hopes to go to a well-established winning environment. At this stage, bill has no specific next home list, but it is reported that bill is willing to join the Celtics, warriors, heat or 76ers. In fact, once bill really applies for a deal, all teams in the League will pursue him.

"Bill is now the only guy in the league who can help win the overall situation and be traded," said a team deputy general manager who asked not to be named

"Grandstand" reporter Jason Dumas followed up the report. The tip he got was that if Bill applied for a trade, the Celtics would be his next choice. Because in this way, bill can compete for the championship with his good friend Jason Tatum.

Another NBA reporter Evan Massey reported that in the process of the warriors pursuing another star, bill is obviously a more likely choice than Damian Lillard. For the warriors, they really want to win more games in Stephen Curry's peak period.

Before the draft conference, the Raptors were recognized as one of the most active teams in the trading market. They can provide bill with a trading quotation based on the signing No. 4 of this year and Pascal siakam. In addition, the pelicans are also one of Bill's interested suitors.

Bill was selected into the US men's basketball team, but he didn't go to Tokyo to participate in the Olympic Games because of triggering a health and safety agreement.
