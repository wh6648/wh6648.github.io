[comprehensive evaluation]

advantage:

Jonathan cumminga is 2.03 meters tall and weighs 95 kg. He has an almost perfect small forward figure. His skeleton is very big. Now, he is the strongest player of his age. Next, he can gain weight without worry after entering the NBA. Cumminga is a sports genius. He has amazing explosive power and outstanding air operation ability. His breakthrough is extremely sharp, and there are many ways to end it. In addition to personal attacks, cumminga also has a good sense and level of passing. In the case of dislocation, he can also rely on his strength to beat his opponent in the low position.

Cumminga's contribution on the defensive side is also omni-directional. Using his beast like physique, he can create a strong sense of oppression for his opponents. He is very in line with the current NBA trend. After training, he is enough to defend from position 1 to position 4. Cumminga's rebounding ability has been proved in the Development League. He has grabbed 7.2 boards per game in the past season. In addition, cumminga is also a good stealer and blocker. These characteristics can only be further highlighted as he continues to grow stronger. Cumminga is also very competitive and rarely has difficulties on the court. As one of the youngest players in this draft, cumminga has been fighting against players older than himself since he grew up. This is undoubtedly very beneficial to his development after entering the NBA.

Disadvantages:

Cumminga's biggest problem is his low offensive efficiency. In high school, cumminga was used to playing star ball. After entering the Development League, some of his bad habits began to be exposed. For example, his attack choice is relatively bad. In the past season, his average three-point shooting rate was only 24.6%. On the free throw line, cumminga's efficiency is also very low. The average shooting rate of 62.5% is basically unqualified for a small forward.

Now, as the third position, cumminga's technology is slightly rough. However, as position 4, he still needs a certain amount of weight gain. Before the offensive skill package continues to be developed, he may encounter the embarrassment of "no three no four" in the NBA. In the low post attack, cumminga's pace is particularly single. His turn is very easy to be seen through, and it is easier to be blocked near the basket. Cumminga's passing intention is very good, but the accuracy and timing of passing need to be improved. In addition, his mistakes are relatively high, which need to be corrected in the future.

[career overview and prospect]

Jonathan cumminga was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on October 6, 2002. It is said that cumminga became interested in basketball at the age of 2. In 2016, cumminga, 15, came to live in the United States, and his basketball career has been a wonderful picture since then.

As a freshman, cumminga attended Huntington preparatory school in West Virginia. In his sophomore year of senior high school, cumminga made rapid progress in his skills. After transferring to new merican high school, the Savior of New York, he began to become a high school star in the United States. Throughout the season, cumminga averaged 25 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists. Cumminga also participated in the Nike elite youth basketball league in the United States that season. In that game, cumminga's opponents were almost bigger than himself, but he still got the gorgeous data of 20.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. In a game with this year's Quasi champion Cade corningham's team, he scored 43 points and scored 7 out of 11 three-point goals.

At the end of the sophomore season, cumminga became the best sophomore player of the year selected by maxpreps. With the popularity accumulated in this year, cumminga transferred from senior three to parkrick high school in New Jersey, which is also the school where NBA star Carey Owen stayed. Cumminga scored 20 points in the team's debut. But later, cumminga suffered twists and turns. He was suspended for 30 days because of illegal transfer, and then rested for a month because of a sprained ankle. As a result, cumminga averaged 16.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the whole senior three season, and the data shrank.

However, the twists and turns of senior three did not affect cumminga's career prospects. As early as senior two, he had received the invitation to join from Duke University, University of Kentucky and other famous universities. In the evaluation of three authoritative websites, rivals, 247sports and ESPN, he was a stable five-star high school student, ranking fourth in the United States. In addition, cumminga was originally a 2021 high school graduate, but he chose to graduate early in 2020.

To the surprise of many industry experts, cumminga gave up the recruitment of all famous universities and chose to enter the newly established training team (ignition team) of the NBA Development League, and his choice also caused great controversy at that time.

In July 2020, cumminga officially signed a one-year contract with the igniter team to fight in the NBA Development League. Because of the epidemic, cumminga didn't play the first game until February 10, 2021. In his debut, he got 19 points, 4 assists and 4 rebounds, and led the team to win the Santa Cruz warriors led by (former) NBA players such as Lin Shuhao and Jordan Poole. Throughout the season, cumminga played 13 games in the ignition team, averaging 15.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists.

At the end of the season, cumminga announced to participate in this year's NBA draft conference, but it should be noted that his draft ranking is slightly lower than that predicted a year ago, about in the range of 5 to 7. It is also worth mentioning that cumminga's brother once played NCAA, and former NBA player Emanuel mudier is cumminga's cousin. Cumminga's mother tongue is French. He didn't start learning English until he came to the United States.
