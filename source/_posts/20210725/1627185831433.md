On July 25, Phoenix Suns officially announced today that Jeff Bowe, vice president of basketball operations of the team, will leave the team, which is the first personnel change of the Suns after the finals.

Despite losing to the bucks in the NBA Finals, the Suns performed very well in the 2020-21 season and the prospect of the team is also very bright. However, a few days after losing game 6 of the finals series, the Suns made a change of personality. Jeff Bauer, vice president of basketball operations, will leave the team.

"I'm glad to be part of this team. We are very proud of the progress and achievements made in the past two seasons. I look forward to more cooperation opportunities in the future." Jeff Bauer said.

Most people don't know Jeff Bauer because he is more like a behind the scenes figure. Jeff Bauer joined the suns in 2019 and brought rich experience to this job. At that time, James Jones was the general manager of the team, and Jeff Bauer helped Jones and team owner Robert sarve complete the transition of the team.

Before joining the Suns, Jeff Bauer served as general manager of the Detroit Pistons from 2014 to 2018. Powell also worked in New Orleans for many years. In the 2005 NBA draft, he played an important role in the selection of Chris Paul in the fourth place. In addition, Bauer even served as the head coach of Nola before briefly coaching NCAA in 2013-14, but he finally returned to Detroit. Obviously, not many people know Bauer, but he is a smart basketball manager. He is undoubtedly an important part of the sun's reconstruction. Considering his relationship with Paul, he may be an important factor in signing the 11 time all star player during the off-season last season.
