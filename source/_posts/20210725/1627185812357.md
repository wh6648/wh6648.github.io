On July 25, Toronto Raptors star Pascal siakam has been proved to be the key of the team. However, this does not mean that the Raptors did not consider the possibility of transporting him out of the city. According to bleacher report reporter Jack Fisher, the Raptors have put siakam on the shelf, which has been involved in various transaction negotiations. If they don't succeed, they will give up siakam in exchange for more draft rights and completely rebuild.

With the 2021 NBA draft approaching, the Raptors also began to actively plan various transactions. Raptors can offer a package deal around signing 4 and siakam. League sources believe that the Raptors are considered to be one of the most active teams in pre draft trading. They are exploring various ways to exchange for an all-star player, preferably Bradley bill or Damian Lillard. They may have to give up shaikham and number four in next week's 2021 NBA draft. Kyle Lowry will leave as a free agent, which seems to be a foregone conclusion, which means that the Raptors need to make up for their losses and strengthen their backcourt.

Siakam is the No. 1 scoring king of the Raptors in the 2020-21 season, averaging 21.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, but his shooting rate is the lowest in his career. Nevertheless, if he does leave, he will be a solid supplement. The warriors are looking for a new star, and siakam may meet this requirement.
