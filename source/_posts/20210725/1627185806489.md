On July 25, according to a report from NBA reporter Evan Massey, informed sources revealed that if Bradley bill applied for a transaction and completed the transaction, the wizards will soon seek a transaction to send Russell Westbrook away.

Bill is like a domino. Once he leaves Washington, it means that the wizards will be completely rebuilt. However, at this stage, there is no news that bill has officially applied for a deal with the Wizards.

As a three double king, will weishao have four teams in four years? During the off-season in 2019, Willis left the thunder team for 11 years and chose to go to Houston to join his good friend James Harden. But in the Rockets, Wesson worked with harden for only one year. In the off-season of 2020, Wei Shao was sent to the Wizards by the Rockets.

When he returned to play under his mentor Scott Brooks, Wesson's performance in the 20-21 season was commendable. Unfortunately, the wizards were eliminated by the 76ers in the first round of the playoffs.

For the 32 year old weishao, the big contract makes the transaction not easy. Weishao's existing contract will expire in the summer of 2023, with 22-23 seasons as the player option. Next season, Wesson's annual salary is $44.21 million and $47.06 million for the 22-23 season.

According to previous rumors, the Lakers, who aim to strengthen the backcourt during the off-season, are interested in Wesson. The question now is, what kind of trading chips can the Lakers offer?
