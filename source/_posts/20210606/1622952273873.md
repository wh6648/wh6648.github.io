On June 6, according to a report by the famous NBA reporter Samas chalaniya, a well-informed source revealed that many teams in the league, including several big market teams, are paying close attention to the status quo of the Blazers team, and they are looking forward to the opportunity to offer Damian Lillard.

The Blazers lost home to the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs on Saturday, leaving them 2-4 out. This is the Blazers' fourth playoff first round exit in nearly five years!

At the end of the game, lilard put out a line on social media: "how long do I have to dedicate? When will the opportunity come? " In this dynamic review area, a large number of Laker fans recruited Lillard to play in Los Angeles.

According to a tip from Yahoo sports reporter Chris Hannes, lilard will focus on competing for the championship. In the future, he will talk more about his requirements and the team. In fact, just after the Trail Blazers were out, the team's official announcement and Terry stotz parted ways.

According to the source, Lillard will have an important say in the process of selecting a new coach for the Blazers. Speaking of stotz's dismissal, Lillard said: "I'm frustrated because I don't like change very much. In my memory of wearing this shirt, I have him in every shot."

It has been pointed out that stoz has got two clear tasks this season, one is to improve his defense, the other is to win the next round of the series. As a result, he failed to complete both tasks. Last season, the defense efficiency of the Trail Blazers ranked 27th in the league. This season, after the introduction of Derek Jones and Robert coventon, the defense efficiency of the Trail Blazers dropped to 29th in the league.

Lillard's current contract expires in the summer of 2025, and his annual salary for the next four seasons is $43.75 million, $47.25 million, $50.75 million and $54.25 million, respectively.
