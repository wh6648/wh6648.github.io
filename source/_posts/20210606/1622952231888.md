On June 6, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Brooklyn nets at home ushered in the Milwaukee Bucks with the eastern semi-final opener. At the end of the game, the nets won the Bucks 115-107 and made a good start to the series.

Originally, the bucks and the nets this game, the former is a very good chance to win.

After all, one of the core of the nets, James Harden, played dozens of seconds in the opening, and then hurried out of the game. However, after the whole game, the Bucks didn't have the chance to win. The whole team lost the game without fighting spirit. You don't seem to realize that the bucks are playing such an important game as the eastern semi-final.

The nets have never been a good defensive team. However, this night, their defense to the bucks and their restrictions on brother Letterman are very targeted. Throughout the game, they didn't give brother Letterman too much pressure to pinch. Instead, they let him go to attack. Although the letter also made some outside shots and got regular scores through surprise attacks, it is obvious that in Nash's view, brother letterman's contribution is very important, You can't win the net at all.

However, in addition to the letter brother, the nets were on guard against the Bucks' second and third leaders, huoledi and Middleton. Huoledi scored 7 of 19 and only got 17 points in the whole game; Middleton's situation is even worse. He only scored 13 points, made 23 shots and made 17 irons.

Obviously, defense to this extent, the nets this game has been successful for more than half.

Of course, Bucks attack trapped, but also from their own reasons. After all, this game, including the garbage time, Bucks substitute only got 16 points in total. You know, for the top talent team like layup net, the Bucks can't take advantage only by starting and competing with their opponents.

The Bucks have to tap some new potential from the second team when the main force is limited and there is no firepower to support them. But maybe the first round revenge heat is too relaxed this year, which makes coach budenhower have blind optimism. This night, he is still in the regular and rigid rotation. In the game, from the coach's on-the-spot scheduling, there is no sense of urgency in the eastern semi-finals.

In the whole game, the Bucks made 6 of 30 three-point shots and the alphabet brother made 2 of 5, which turned out to be the highest three-point hit rate of the whole team. This kind of output is obviously extremely abnormal.

On the other side of the net, the whole game was very alert. After harden retired from the game, Owen and Durant quickly took over the attack without too much adjustment. From point to area, other people in the net, such as Griffin, Joe Harris, and even Mike James on the bench, were activated. A big win came naturally.

Previously, in an interview, Nets coach Nash said that with the promotion of the playoffs, nets have gradually formed the expected chemical reaction, but in the team cooperation at the same time, the leading ability of superstars is also important, both need to be taken into account.
