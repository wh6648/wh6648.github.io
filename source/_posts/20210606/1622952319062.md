June 6 news, from the NBA's famous reporter Samas chalaniya reported that informed sources revealed that the 76ers star Joel enbid in the Eastern Conference semi-final G1 state is playing into doubt.

According to the schedule, in the early hours of next Monday morning, the Eastern Conference semi-final G1 will start to compete, when the 76ers will play the eagles at home.

The media and fans are concerned about whether "the great emperor" will come back in G1? He was injured in the G4 in the first round of the playoffs when he lost his balance and fell to the ground after fighting Robin Lopez on the offensive. It wasn't long before nbid left to return to the dressing room.

The diagnosis revealed a small meniscus tear on the lateral side of his right knee, and he missed the first round of the playoffs in G5. The 76ers official said that there was no need for surgery for nbid's injury. The team used physiotherapy and made a clear treatment plan.

It is worth mentioning that in March this year, nbid had a similar injury, when he suffered from bone bruises and was absent for 10 games.

According to the source, the 76ers will decide whether to play next Monday based on his treatment and training. At this stage, his probability is 50%.

The 27 year old played his best season in his career. In the regular season, he averaged 28.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game, with a shooting percentage of 51.3%, leading the 76ers to enter the playoffs as the first in the East.
