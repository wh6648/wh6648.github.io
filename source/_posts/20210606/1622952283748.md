On June 6, Monterey Harrell appeared dissatisfied with his performance in the first round series of the playoffs between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns. The big man didn't get much playing time, and Harrell posted some vague messages on personal social media today expressing his discomfort with the situation.

Harrell posted a picture comparing his performance last year and this year on personal social media: "in 2020, the best sixth man Harrell can average 19 points and 7 rebounds per game; In 2021, against the Suns series, he was beaten by DNP twice, averaging only 9.8 minutes per game. I'm just doing what the team asks me to do

In fact, this is not the first time that Harrell has vented his dissatisfaction on social media. Earlier this week, he tweeted that wasting time is the worst feeling. In the second half of this season, with the joining of Andre Drummond, Harrell's playing opportunities have been greatly reduced. In the playoff series against the Suns, Harrell did not even get a chance to play in the G2 and G3 games. "The worst feeling is a waste of time," Harrell tweeted on social media about coach Vogel's abandonment

In this season's farewell meeting of the Lakers, Harrell was also asked about falling out of the rotation lineup, for which Harrell said: "why do I fall out? You asked the wrong person

In addition, Harrell declined to say whether he will return to the Lakers next season or whether he will become a free agent. It's a tough situation for the Lakers, but fans think Harrell should get a second chance in the team.
