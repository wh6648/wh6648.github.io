On June 6, ESPN columnist Zach Lowe reported that a well-informed source revealed that nets forward Jeff Green may return at some point during the series against bucks.

The first round of the playoffs G2, green due to injury exit, after diagnosis, he suffered plantar fascia strain. At that time, the nets official said that green would be reevaluated in 10 days.

After the injury, green put on protective boots, so he was absent for three consecutive games. Now the situation is that green is determined to be absent from the Eastern Conference semi-final G1 with bucks, and the media and fans are concerned about when he will come back?

In the current system of the nets, green is an important rotation player. His injury has affected the rotation of the nets.

Speaking of Green's absence, Nets coach Steve Nash said: "we are missing an all-around player who can defend multiple positions and play different roles in the offensive end. Obviously, it's a loss for us. We miss him a lot in the past few games, but we have to work hard and win in his absence. I hope he can come back soon

"In terms of positioning and rotation, we're missing a button, he's not here, we're missing a lot of flexible strategies," Nash continued. "When he comes back, he'll be able to connect seamlessly and go back to the previous mode of operation. I'm not sure if we're going to let him defend Letterman, we didn't say that. We will definitely miss him, but we have not appointed him to defend the letter brother
