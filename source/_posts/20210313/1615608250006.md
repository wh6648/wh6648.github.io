On March 13, according to reports from a number of team reporters, Laker coach Frank Vogel talked about the comeback of "big Brow" Anthony Davis in the latest interview.

Woshuai revealed that the team has not reevaluated the injury of nongmeige, but the evaluation will be carried out soon. After today's game, the result is expected to be updated.

In fact, since entering the new year, thick eyebrow's physical condition has been poor, minor injury and minor illness. At first, thick eyebrow has been trying to adhere to, but the accumulation of fatigue, or make his injury worse.

As a result, when they realized that he was suffering from Achilles tendon injury, the Lakers no longer dare to be careless. For the long-term goal of defending the title, they had to let him rest and no longer set a time limit for his comeback.

Although, this season, the state of thick eyebrow brother is not good, he only played 23 games, averaging only 22.5 points and 8.4 rebounds. However, in a month and a half of the injury, the Lakers still encountered unprecedented trouble.

During this period, the Los Angeles Lakers suffered overtime in a row, but also twice swallowed the bitter fruit of losing in a row. The basic set of the Lakers was completely disrupted, and the rotation plan of the team was also destroyed. A lot of games, although the Lakers and opponents fight to the end, but the critical moment, due to lack of firepower, they are defeated in the attack.

In addition, in the ranking, the Lakers have fallen to the third place in the west, which exacerbates the crisis and frustration within the team.

Of course, it must be irrational to learn from the lessons of our predecessors and let a player with Achilles tendon injury return blindly. At that time, Durant's hasty return caused the devastating blow of Achilles tendon rupture later.
