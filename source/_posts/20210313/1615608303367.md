March 13 news, film director and producer, New York Knicks Super Fans Spike Lee for Madison Square Garden management staff is very disappointed. Patrick Ewing led the Georgetown Hoya to a 72-71 win over the top seeded Wildcats on Thursday local time, which was the most significant win in Ewing's coaching career. However, Ewing was annoyed when he was intercepted by security guards in Madison before the game. Today, Spike Lee said in a guest show that he couldn't believe what happened to Ewing.

Ewing is considered one of the greatest players in the history of the New York Knicks, however, it turns out that not everyone in the city knows who he is. Recently, Ewing revealed that he was often intercepted by security guards at Madison Square Garden Arena. Because of Ewing's position in the history of the Knicks team, obviously, this matter has a great influence.

"I can't believe it happened to Ewing. It would never happen to any other team. I'm not blaming Doran, but there must be something wrong with Madison Square Garden. Can you imagine that Derek KITT is banned from Yankee Stadium? Magic Johnson is blocked from Staples Center? Michael Jordan is blocked from United Center? It's a very bad image, especially for the Knicks. After the incident, I called Ewing, who was still very unhappy when talking to me and was shocked by the so-called "disrespect." Spike Lee said.

Ewing can contribute 22.8 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks in the midfield of 15 seasons for the Knicks. Under the leadership of Ewing, the Knicks once entered the NBA Finals in 1994 and 1999.
