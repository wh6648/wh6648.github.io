On March 13, Jackie McMillan, a famous American basketball player, reported that according to the tip she got, the Timberwolves are eager to get John Collins, the Hawks' inside star.

"The Timberwolves really want him, and I think other teams want him, too, but, in my opinion, Minnesota has a special desire for him." Said McMullan.

So far this season, the Timberwolves have only won eight games, ranking first from the bottom in the league. It seems that this season, the team is going to be bad again.

However, just before the All-Star weekend, the Timberwolves adjusted the coaching staff. The team fired Ryan sanders and hired Raptors assistant Chris finch as the new manager.

And after the change, the team did show some different mental outlook. Yesterday, the Timberwolves beat the pelicans and stopped the losing streak. Vinci dug deep into the bench to achieve this victory.

Of course, Finch's adjustment is not over. Now, the rumor between wolves and John Collins may also have a direct relationship with the new manager.

Collins's ability is needless to say. Last season, he averaged 20 + 10 per game and hit 40% of the three points.

But this season, the Hawks personnel changes, affected Collins's play, the season to now, his field average score fell to 17.8 points, rebounds is only 7.6, in addition, his playing time has shrunk.

For a player whose goal is to get a top salary contract, such data is obviously unsatisfactory. What's worse, in the season, Collins also had conflicts with core Trey young.

If Collins can join the Timberwolves, he can become a reliable partner in Downes' inner line. According to McMillan, Collins' camp also means to change teams. Collins has a strong interest in playing with Downes.
