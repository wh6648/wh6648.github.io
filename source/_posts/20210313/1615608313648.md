On March 13, according to league sources, PJ Tucker became more and more frustrated because he was not traded to a competitive team, and made it clear that he would choose a truce until the Rockets completed the trade before the deadline. Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle has revealed more about Tucker's departure.

Tucker's days with the Rockets may be coming to an end. This is his fourth season in Houston. He decided to leave the team in order to play for the championship. In the last game with the kings, Tucker did not appear on the court, this departure is likely to be permanent. According to sources, the Rockets' trading goal is to trade tucker for a young player, not just to collect draft rights.

"Until he (Tucker) is not in this team, we have to try to find the most suitable plan for him, and also the most suitable plan for us," Rockets coach Silas said. "We all know that this is a difficult year. He has been very professional and has been doing his best on the field, but at this point, we need to make the best choice for the team and at the same time maximize Tucker's interests, That's probably why he can't continue to be here. "

Jonathan Feigen reported that a person familiar with the matter said that at the beginning of the season, Tucker had been dissatisfied with the failure to reach an extension agreement with the Rockets, and he wanted to join a new team to show his value. However, at some point in the Rockets' last game against Sacramento, Tucker's agent reached an agreement with general manager stone that Tucker would no longer play for the Rockets.

So far this season, Tucker's record of 267 consecutive games has been broken due to a thigh injury. Although he is the team's top defensive player, his role in the Rockets system has changed, with an average of only 4.1 shots per game, the lowest since the 2006-07 season.
