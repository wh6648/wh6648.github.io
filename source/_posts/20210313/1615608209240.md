March 13 news, for the Golden State Warriors and clay Thompson, the past few seasons have been very difficult. Clay Thompson suffered anterior cruciate ligament tears in the sixth game of the 2019 NBA Finals against the Raptors, and suffered Achilles tendon tears before the 2020-21 season. Clay is expected to remain silent, focus on his recovery from injury and support his teammates on the sidelines during training and competition. But this is not the case. According to dream green, clay is more talkative than ever.

"It's a brand new clay (Thompson), and this guy's words are endless now," dream Green said on Sirius XM NBA radio. "He used to be very quiet, but now he talks all the time, whether on the plane or in the dressing room. I'm not bored. It's the most incredible thing. Curry and I both laughed

In addition, dream also talked about the new division of top spot James - Wiseman because he forgot before the new crown test was coach Cole suspended three quarters. "I'm not questioning what Cole did, I'm just not sure I'll do it because there are too many tests. Tomorrow we will have three new crown tests, one at 8-9 am, one at 5-6 PM and one at 10-11 PM. We will have three tests. I fully understand his decision to be suspended because of his absence from training, but I won't be angry that Wiseman missed the test during the All Star Holiday. But Cole said that he (Wiseman) not only missed the test, but also missed the training. About missing the training, I can fully understand Cole's decision. "
