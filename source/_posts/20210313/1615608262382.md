On March 13, according to the report of Kelly IACO, the reporter of the Olympic rockets and team, a number of sources revealed that before the trade deadline (March 26), in addition to PJ Tucker, Ben mcclemo also attracted the interest of many teams competing for the championship.

Since the mid January deal with harden, the Rockets have become the fish belly of the league. After losing to King yesterday, they have suffered a wave of 14 losses in a row.

Although the management of the Rockets never admit that they are bad, the reality is that this summer, the first round signing of the Rockets is protected in the first four. Therefore, this season has become a good time for them to be bad. Once the Rockets are rotten, those players who are not in line with the future construction direction of the Rockets will naturally become the main clean-up objects of the team.

According to previous reports, Tucker will no longer play for the Rockets. In addition to Tucker, the 28 year old is not in Houston's long-term plan. This season, mcclemo averaged 15.6 minutes in the Rockets, with only 6.4 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists.

In the previous two seasons, mcclemo's three-point shooting rate once reached 40%, but this season, his outside line efficiency is only 30.9%, which has become the main reason for the team to sell him.

However, some analysts believe that mcclemo is still in the age of playing. As a substitute shooter of a team, mcclemo is a good option to enrich the bench.

In the previous interview, the top management of the Rockets disclosed that they did not want to rebuild in a long-term way by "believing in the process", that is to say, the Rockets will send away those players who are suitable for trading as soon as possible.
