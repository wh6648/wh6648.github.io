On April 27, Anthony Davis contributed 18 points and 8 rebounds, and Dennis Schroeder scored 13 of the 21 points in the fourth quarter, leading the Lakers to beat the magic 114-103.

Speaking of the team's performance in the second quarter, Davis said: "in the second quarter, we had a bad performance on both sides of the attack and defense, but we solved the problem in the second half. It's going to come back, we're going to use the last 11 games to play our chemistry and win at the same time

Speaking of his performance, Davis said: "I am still looking for the rhythm of the game. I may never make five mistakes in a game again, but the team has covered up those mistakes for me with some important actions. I've missed 30 games before, so I think I've got enough rest and I can play in all the back-to-back games

"I'm glad to finally see him shooting more than 50% (laughter)," coach Vogel said of Davis after the game

At the same time, coach Vogel also praised Schroeder's performance: "I think Dennis (Schroeder) has become the team's field Master, James's absence accelerated his growth, which may be the unexpected harvest of injury."

"LeBron (James) does what he does, Anthony Davis is doing what he should do... But when we need to shoot and LeBron is not on the court... Whatever happens, I'm ready to take these challenges." Schroeder said.

In addition, Schroeder also said that James is close to comeback, "LeBron (James) is coming back soon... We are really excited that we can start to fight side by side with him soon. I know when he will be back, but I will let the team announce it
