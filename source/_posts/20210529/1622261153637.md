On May 29, NBA columnist Zach Lowe reported that the Bucks refused to mess up at the end of the regular season, according to informed sources.

For the penultimate game of the regular season, the Bucks play the heat at home. The situation was that if the Bucks lost, they could avoid meeting the heat in the first round of the playoffs.

Sources said the Bucks had a serious internal discussion on the issue. In the end, the Bucks decided to refuse to mess up because they wanted to go into the playoffs with a winning rhythm.

The Bucks beat the heat 122-108 in four quarters on May 16. At the end of the regular season, Bucks ranked third in the East with 46-26.

It is worth mentioning that the Bucks were eliminated by the heat 4-1 in the Eastern Conference semi-finals in the playoffs held in the closed Disney park last year. So this year, it's a war of revenge for the bucks.

It's a good game for the bucks. The Bucks beat the heat on Friday and are 3-0 ahead of the heat. It can be said that the Bucks have advanced to the eastern semi-finals, because in the history of NBA, there has never been a team that was 0-3 behind in the total score.
