On May 29, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely, with the Brooklyn nets losing 119-125 to the Boston Celtics, and the total score was pulled to 1-2 by the green army¡° "Attacking kaleidoscope" Owen was obviously booed by the green army fans. He made 6 of 17 shots and scored 16 points. Moreover, Owen became the "background emperor" in the dazzling skills of smart and Tatum in playing 4 and 3 points.

Owen played for Celtic for two seasons in 2017-2019, but the two sides didn't get along well. Turning to the shooting net and facing his old club in the playoffs, when Owen came into the field to warm up, Celtic fans booed the former core of the team, and Owen also responded with gestures.

It was amid the boos that Owen opened the third game of his series. Owen, who has played 12 minutes in the first quarter, seems to have been booed. He has played hard in all his three sports attacks, only sending out two assists and one rebound.

It is precisely because Owen's hand is not good, once leading 15 points of the net by the "green shirt" single section to achieve anti super. However, Owen is an attacking kaleidoscope after all. It is unrealistic to block his scoring completely.

In the second quarter, when it was 6:47, Owen dribbled and broke through. Near the free throw line, he stopped to shoot. Facing rookie Pritchard's defense, Owen avoided the block of Langford with his ability of staying in the air. He easily hit the ball and ended his scoring shortage.

However, Owen only had two points in the first half, and the feeling of shooting one out of five in the sports war was a bit embarrassing, which equaled his lowest score in the first half of his playoff career.

Compared with the first two quarters, Owen's attack in the third quarter was improved. He hit after two breakthroughs. However, when he just hit his third goal, Owen blocked Smart's ultra long three points on the defensive end and became the 3 + 1 background.

After that, Owen's mentality was obviously out of balance. He forced to shoot twice at the offensive end. First, he stopped the shot and went out of the way, then he was blocked by the basket in the face of two defenders' layups. To make matters worse, he later became the background for Tatum to play three points.

In this year's playoffs, Owen scored three of 11 three-point goals in the first two games. After all the three-point scoring in the first three games, he scored two three-point goals in the fourth quarter. It's a pity that Owen is just looking back. After that, he committed an offensive foul and failed to make a three-point shot, which made the net hopeless.
