On May 29, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Brooklyn nets away ushered in the third game of the series with Boston Celtics, after the game, the nets lost 119-125 to the green army, the total score was 1-2.

In this game, harden scored 41 points, 10 assists, 7 rebounds, hit 7 three points, 13 free throws in 12, presenting the most brilliant personal performance after the injury, and became the first player in the history of the basketball net playoffs to output at least 40 points and 10 assists in a single game. Unfortunately, his efforts failed to help the nets win.

Series before the two games, the nets in the face of the residual battle of Celtic, win are very easy.

But discerning people can see that G1, G2 and Durant are the absolute core of the net attack. Although harden has stable output, he has made some sacrifices in tactics.

However, the game away green shirt, nets made some adjustments, the opening stage, the team's attack completely controlled by mustache.

In the first attack of the first quarter, harden forced a breakthrough and hit 2 + 1. Then, he assisted Durant to hit the three-point ball. His strong attack, "touch porcelain" free throw and three-point backward step also hit continuously.

After only three minutes, harden has used his full set of skills. His playing style seems to be back to the era of rockets, the time when he can attack without scruple and switch freely. However, different from the period of the Rockets, with the help of the nets, Durant and Owen, harden can display his talent more confidently without worrying about too many attacks from his opponents.

As a result, the game just played 4 minutes, the nets have achieved 15 points advantage, the middle of this section, with harden step back three-point ball again, he has 4 shots 4 to get 13 points. What's more amazing is that after two assists from Durant, his assists also reached four times.

But maybe it was too smooth in the first quarter. After harden, he relaxed. This kind of habitual relaxation often appeared in the rocket period.

For a period of time, harden didn't stick to personal attack any more. As long as he had the chance, his first choice was to pass the ball to his teammates. However, bearded's attack declined, which gave the green army a chance to breathe. Unconsciously, the difference was overtaken by the home team.

Entering the second quarter, harden is still using the pass to connect the whole team, but his limelight is obviously not as strong as the first quarter. Maybe they are too confident about their own strength, even if the score is behind, the net has not been adjusted too much, they still allow harden to hold the ball slowly in the attack.

However, compared with harden's slowness, the green shirt soldiers showed a fighting attitude. The different attitudes of both sides to the game are naturally reflected in the score.

So next, the nets fell into a long passive. As a last resort, harden can only take out more powerful offensive firepower. In the third quarter, he scored 20 points after a free throw, and then he assisted Durant in three-point shooting and double assists.
