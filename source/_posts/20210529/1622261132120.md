On May 29, NBA reporter Bryan wenhorst reported that the wizard star Russell Westbrook did not participate in today's training. Because of his right ankle injury, the G3 of the Wizards' home game against the 76ers on Sunday was listed as doubtful.

Williams was injured on Thursday when the Wizards lost 95-120 to the 76ers. With 10 minutes to go in the fourth quarter, he sprained his ankle and left the game, then didn't return. Earlier in G2, Wesson twisted his right ankle when defending Ben Simmons.

It's worth mentioning that when entering the players' passageway, Philadelphia fans threw popcorn and yelled rubbish words at him, which caused his strong dissatisfaction. He was ready to theorize and the result was stopped. Later, the 76ers announced that the fan was disqualified from season tickets and was banned from participating in any activities at the 76ers' home stadium indefinitely.

Wizard coach Scott Brooks said in an interview today that major general Williams tested his injured ankle on Saturday morning local time to determine whether he will play in the G3.

Wei Shao's performance in the first two games of the first round of the playoffs was not satisfactory, with only 9 of 27 shots, 36.0 minutes per game, 13.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 12.5 assists, of which the scores and rebounds dropped significantly compared with the regular season.

If Wei Shao can't play, the attack pressure of the wizards will be all on Bradley bill.
