On May 29, the NBA playoffs continued. In the first round of the Eastern Conference, the Knicks and the Hawks, who had drawn 1-1 in the first two games, went to Atlanta for the third game. In the end, the Knicks lost 94-105 to the hawks and fell behind 1-2. Randall, the core of the Knicks, had a cold hand. He only got 14 points and 11 rebounds in 2 of 15 shots. Ross, who entered the starting line-up of the game, performed well. He made 13 of 12 shots, scored 3 of 5, scored 30 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists.

As like as two peas, the Randall, who played the most advanced season in the regular season, has experienced a great decline in the first postseason tour. In the playoff intensity, Randall's first two matches received the same data as 15 points, 12 rebounds and 4 assists, obviously lower than the regular season's performance. In the third game of the playoffs, Randall not only did not improve his performance, but also fell into the mire under the Hawks' heavy defense.

From the beginning of the game, he had no feeling at all, and the Hawks' targeted defense made his offensive opportunities scarce. The first four shots in the first quarter all hit the iron, until the end of the first quarter scored three points before hitting his first goal, but it also became his only goal in nearly three quarters. In the second quarter, the two three-point shot was still a tiebreaker, which could only rely on the hard free throw to increase points. It was his low attack that delayed the Knicks' overall attack.

At the end of the third quarter, when the difference was over 15 points, Randall finally began to try to attack personally, but the effect was still not good. Although he forced three points to score his second goal in the sports game, and forced the inside line to kill, he made two free throws, but it was just a drop in the bucket. At the end of the day, Randall was abandoned.

In the first two games, rose became the most outstanding player in the Knicks team. In this game, he was entrusted with a greater responsibility and became the starting point guard. For rose, more than ten years later, he was still the most reliable player in siberdu, and he didn't disappoint his mentor. This match was in a hot state. He made a sudden stop in the middle shot, made a strong attack by throwing and grabbing, and made a long shot in the back court The top of the arc pursues the body three points to enter again, and after breaking through the forbidden area, there is an emergency stop and turn height difficulty backward jump shot to enter again.

In only six minutes of the first quarter, rose scored 11 points and 3 rebounds in 5-for-6 shots, becoming the most stable scoring point in the Knicks team, which is just the beginning. In the second quarter, the Knicks attack completely stagnated. In the latter part of the second quarter, the Hawks played a wave of 20-3 climax, leading to 14 points. It was Ross who helped the team stop bleeding. Before half-time, he forced a layup to stop the decline.

In the second half, the Knicks' reliance on him became more and more obvious. When his teammates missed the shots one after another, Ross made a sudden stop and shot again. With the help of the cover, he made a three-point sprint. He also made a throw in the penalty area. When he kept scoring, he also made a breakthrough to assist Barrett to make a three-point sprint. At the end of the game, Ross continued his strong offensive performance. He first forced to the basket to make a layup, then broke through Trey Yang's throwing throw, and the long pass from the back court helped Feituo to receive a slam dunk in the air. He forced to make a 2 + 1 attack on the chase and Interception under the basket.

Rose has never given up. Even at the last moment when the situation is over and the victory has been decided, he still scored three points again. But now rose is no longer the rose who can carry the team forward. Even if he tries his best, it is still difficult to help the team win the match.
