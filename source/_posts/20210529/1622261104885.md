On May 29, the Lakers officially announced that pop underwent an MRI examination today, which showed no structural damage to his left knee, just a slight contusion, and is currently on the daily watch list.

Earlier, ESPN reporter Dave reported that pop's left quadriceps condition improved after yesterday's game, and today's MRI results showed no tear. Pop will see his reaction after rest and treatment to decide whether the G4 will play or not.

Popper was injured in the third quarter of the game between the Lakers and the Suns yesterday. With 4 minutes and 16 seconds left in the third quarter, Booker dribbled from the back to make physical contact with him, causing Popper to fall to the ground.

"When he hit me, I immediately felt pain, and it was very painful." "It's so painful that I can't keep playing," Popper said

Pop got 5 points, 4 rebounds and two steals before he left the game. In the series between the Lakers and the Suns, he averaged 4.0 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals. His shooting percentage was only 22.2%, and his three-point shooting percentage was only 8%, which was far lower than his average 9.7 points.

Lakers coach Vogel said that although the team attaches great importance to pop's long-range ability, but in this round of series, his defense against Booker is the most important.
