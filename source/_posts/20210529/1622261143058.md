On May 29, the Bucks officially announced that starting guard Dante Di Vincenzo suffered a ligament tear in his left ankle and will be reimbursed this season.

Devincienzo was injured in the second quarter of the Bucks' away win over the heat on Friday, when he suffered from an injury while holding the ball, felt obvious pain, and then hopped back to the dressing room.

The Bucks initially diagnosed with a tendon injury to his left foot, and coach Mike budenhorse expressed his hope that he would be absent for a short period of time. But today's MRI results showed that di Vincenzo's injury was more serious than expected, leading to the loss of the season.

"It's a huge blow, but sometimes you have to deal with these things, you need to be ready for the next game," budenhower said today. "Other players will get a chance to play."

The 24-year-old started 66 games this season, averaging 10.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.1 steals. In the first three games of the playoffs, di Vincenzo also started. He helped the Bucks lead the heat 3-0.

Budenhower will decide who will start in the G4 to replace dwenzo. When Janice adtokumbo, Chris Middleton, dvincenzo, Zhu hollerdy and Brooke Lopez started this season, the Bucks were 34-14.
