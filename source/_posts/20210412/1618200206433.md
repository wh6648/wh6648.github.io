The Philadelphia 76ers are still one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference and the NBA, and even if Joel enbid is injured, they are still competitive. Now enbid is back on the court and trying to get back to the best. That's what the 76 man legend Julius Owen believes, considering what nbid has brought to Philadelphia and how the team has performed under his leadership. Dr. J. believes that the 76ers would not have succeeded without enbid.

"Of course, he is the leader of the team. Without him, even if the team has achieved such a great success, I don't think it would have been possible to reach the top once, unless some teams were defeated by others. You can't count on that, you have to move on and keep him healthy at the same time. " Dr. J. said in a guest on the Denny green show.

Enbid is the best player in the team. If he can keep fit, he will still be the favorite of MVP and lead the 76ers to go further in the playoffs. Dr. J said in the program that the 76ers have the ability to beat the big three nets and stand out from the East.

"I'm going to put my money on the 76ers. It's self-confidence. Self confidence is very cool, so you need to keep self-confidence, then go out and perform well. That's my opinion." Said Dr. J.

Although the lineup of the nets is very luxurious, with Kevin Durant, Carey Owen and James Harden, the 76ers also have an advantage, that is, the players have worked together for many years, and they have a very good chemical reaction. Therefore, Dr. J is more optimistic about the 76ers to win the championship.

"First of all, in terms of the coaching staff, the 76ers have a certain advantage. Doug rivers is a champion coach. In addition, Dwight Howard also has championship experience. Besides, Ben and Joel are both ambitious now. These guys are very eager to win the championship. They have been in this "process" for some years. Now it's time to reap the fruits. " Said Dr. J.
