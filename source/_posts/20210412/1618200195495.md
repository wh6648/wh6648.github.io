April 12 news, from the "the Olympic" well-known reporter Samas - chalaniya reported that informed sources revealed that the warriors rookie James - Wiseman suffered a right knee meniscus tear, the return date is uncertain.

Sources said the warriors are worried that Wiseman is likely to miss the rest of the season. This is absolutely bad news for the warriors.

Wiseman was injured in the warriors' game against the rockets on Sunday, when his hand was blocked by Kenyon Martin Jr. and then fell unsteadily, resulting in a right knee injury and leaving the field.

Today, Wiseman underwent an MRI examination, which showed a tear in the meniscus of his right knee. It is pointed out that the warriors will negotiate with doctors in the next few days, and the biggest possibility at this stage is Wiseman's reimbursement this season.

Wiseman is the top player in 2020. The warriors have high expectations for the young inside player, but his overall performance has not met expectations so far this season.

So far this season, Wiseman has averaged 21.4 minutes, 11.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 0.9 blocks.
