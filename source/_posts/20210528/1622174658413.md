On May 28, the Utah Jazz officially announced today that three fans who violated the rules in yesterday's game were banned from watching the game indefinitely.

"The Utah Jazz have zero tolerance for attacks and sabotage. Last night, there was an incident involving verbal dispute, the scene security personnel intervened, and the investigation results showed that three Jazz fans were permanently expelled and banned from watching the game. We apologize to all those affected by this unfortunate incident and condemn the unacceptable behavior of the fans. Sir Utah is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful environment. " The jazz official statement said. It is worth mentioning that the investigation team did not elaborate further on this incident.

According to jazz reporter Andy Larsen, three Jazz fans were expelled yesterday because they booed Jia Morant's family. Associated Press reporter Tim Reynolds revealed that the three fans were rude to Morant's mother.

In addition, according to ESPN reporter Adrian wojnarowsk, a Utah judge today dismissed a $100 million lawsuit filed by two fans against Russell Westbrook and the jazz, according to a court document. It happened in March 2019 when two Jazz fans were suspended for life for abusing visiting player Westbrook. The two fans, Shane Keisel and Jennifer huff, subsequently sued Westbrook and jazz for $100 million in damages for defamation and emotional pressure.
