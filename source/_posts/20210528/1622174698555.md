On May 28, the Lakers officially announced that they have reached an extension with Staples Center. According to the information obtained by the Los Angeles Times, the two sides will renew their contracts for 20 years. In other words, the Staples Center will be the home of the Lakers until the 2041 season.

In the last 21 seasons, the Lakers have taken Staples Center as their home court. The renewal of the contract expresses the confidence of both sides in each other.

It is worth mentioning that the current Staples Center is the common home of the Lakers and Clippers. However, the Clippers' new home project has started and is expected to be put into use in the 2024-25 season.

On the other hand, the Lakers will play the Suns at home today. Before the game, Laker owner Jennie bass updated social media and wrote, "2952, 2952, 2952... Let me repeat that number again and let it sink."

"It's 2952 days since we last played in the playoffs at Staples Center. Let's cheer up today, whether it's at Staples Center or at home, we will respect our opponents and each other. "

Not counting last year's playoffs, the last time the Lakers played at home in the playoffs was back in 2013, when they lost 4-0 to the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.
