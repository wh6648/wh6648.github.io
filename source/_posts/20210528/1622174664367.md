On May 28, according to the famous reporter Marc Stein, league sources revealed that Dallas Lone Ranger has the confidence to renew his contract with Tim Hadaway this summer.

In the first two games of the first round of the playoffs, the lone ranger beat the clippers, the champion of this season, and returned home with a 2-0 score. Tim Hadaway made a great contribution. In these two playoffs, he made 11 of 17 three-point shots, averaging 24.5 points per game. According to Marc Stein, the lone rangers are confident that they will renew their contract with Harry in the free market this summer.

Hadaway will be a free agent this summer. In this season's regular season, Hadaway has played a total of 70 games, including 31 starts, averaging 16.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists. According to reporter Jake Fischer, if Hadaway plans to test the free market in the off-season, the Miami Heat will be a potential destination, which has been trying to find players to make up for Jay Claude's role in the 2020 finals.
