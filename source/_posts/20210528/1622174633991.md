On May 28, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely, with the Miami heat losing 84-113 to the Milwaukee Bucks, 0-3 behind. 31 year old butler contributed 19 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists, scoring a series high. However, because his teammates scored really suck, it led him to only score 3 points in the second half, and the heat was another defeat.

As in the past, Butler's offensive end still has to face the "letter brother" defense. From the performance of the first quarter, Butler has no chance to score in the face of the "letter brother" who is tall and arm long.

However, experienced Butler still has the ability to grasp the pick and roll after the "letter brother" short dislocation defense space, the first time shooting. In the first 11 minutes, Butler made 3 of 5 shots and got 7 points. Although these 7 points were all obtained when there was no "letter brother", it was better to have one than none.

Butler in the face of "letter brother" did not taste the sweet, but the bloody Butler chose to tit for tat, also caused the "letter brother" offensive foul in the defensive end.

In the past two series, Butler has never scored more than four goals in sports. However, with five minutes left in the second quarter of the game, Butler hit his second three-point goal in the bottom corner, and his number of goals reached five, a new high in this year's playoffs.

Because the heat were 19 points behind at the most, and the team felt bad except for Butler, so Butler had to turn into a lone hero again. He contributed 9 points in the second quarter and 16 points in the half, narrowing the difference between the two teams to 13 points with his own efforts.

You know, Butler made 6 of 12 shots in two quarters, while the rest of the heat made 8 of 33 shots. The heat have been suppressed by the Bucks due to the extremely unbalanced shooting percentage.

Butler is 31 years old. For this veteran, if he needs to do everything by himself, he is also very busy.

In the third quarter, Butler only scored 3 points against the bucks. Although his 19 points in the third quarter set a new personal high in this series, the heat fell behind by 26 points at the end of the third quarter.

As the Bucks will always keep the difference in more than 20 points, and the Bucks hit rate is also maintained at more than 50%, so Butler did not have the desire to attack in the fourth quarter. From the third quarter to the fourth quarter, Butler only scored 3 points. When he was replaced with 6:30 seconds left, the veteran was helpless. After all, he was completely dragged down by his teammates.
