Raptors star Chris Boucher announced on social media earlier today that he would not represent Canada in this summer's men's basketball playoffs at the Tokyo Olympic Games, US media reported on May 28.

In this regard, Boucher also gave his own reasons.

"To all the fans who asked me why I wasn't on the Canadian men's basketball training list, I was also disappointed that I couldn't play this summer, but I've decided to continue to take the time to recover my knee injury to make sure I'm completely healthy next season. I believe I will watch the game at home and cheer for my brothers. " Boucher wrote.

According to the arrangement, the Olympic Games play off will be held from June 29 to July 4 (local time), when the Canadian team will fight at home in Victoria. And their division, opponents are China, Greece, as well as the Czech Republic, Turkey and Uruguay.

Canada, China and Greece are in group A, while the three teams in group B are Czech Republic, Turkey and Uruguay. According to the arrangement, only the last division champion can get an Olympic ticket.

In order to prepare for the playoff, the Canadian team has recently released a 21 person training list, more than half of the players in the team are NBA active players.

However, it should be pointed out that due to the conflict between the preparation for the playoff and the NBA playoff time, Barrett, Dillon Brooks and others have not yet determined whether to participate.

However, before that, warriors star Andrew Wiggins will definitely participate in this competition, or attracted the attention of all parties.

As an inside player, Chris Boucher's absence is undoubtedly quite a pity. This season, Boucher made rapid progress in the Raptors. He averaged 13.6 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game. All three data are the highest values in his career. In the eyes of some experts, he is also one of the players who made the fastest progress this season.
