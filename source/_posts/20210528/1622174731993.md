Kevin Durant was born in Prince George County, Washington, DC, on September 29, 1988. When KD was less than one year old, his biological father Wayne ran away from home mercilessly and disappeared in the next ten years. Therefore, KD grew up under the care of his mother, grandmother and brother throughout his childhood.

When Durant was born, her mother, Wanda Pratt, was only 21 years old. However, she supported the whole family by herself. As a child, KD has been living on the edge of the poverty line. He is very thin and lacks a sense of security, but the only thing to be thankful for is that he is much taller than his peers.

Durant's natural height advantage made him come into contact with basketball early. At that time, when Michael Jordan was playing in Washington, DC, KD was also affected by this upsurge. Like many children in DC, KD took playing in NBA as his future ideal.

Fortunately, in the first contact with basketball days, godfather Talas Brown taught Durant a lot of basketball knowledge. With KD growing up, he showed his unique talent on the court when he was in middle school. He began to compete frequently in the same age group. During that time, he met another basketball career leader Charles Craig.

In Craig's careful guidance, Durant's ball skills by leaps and bounds. Not only that, in the early days of KD's career, he always had a good partner by his side, that is, Michael Beasley, who will also enter the NBA as the top player in the future. Durant and Beasley are the best friends off the field, but on the field, they are never humble opponents. In the contest with Beasley, KD has made continuous progress and become a famous figure in the United States in high school.

However, KD suffered a major blow in his life in his sophomore year. On April 30, 2005, KD, who was a sophomore in senior high school at that time, was studying in Oak Hill High School, a famous University of basketball in the United States. But the bad news suddenly came that Craig, KD's mentor, was shot dead in Maryland. At that time, he was just trying to mediate the dispute between his friends and others, but he was involved in a tragic shooting incident. He was shot several times in the back and died on the spot

Up to now, Durant often recalled that incident, and up to now, he still does not know what happened at that time. After this incident happened, Du Shao, who was already fragile and sensitive, fell into a long-term trough. He even moved the idea that he didn't want to play basketball any more.

Fortunately, his mother's teaching gave Durant the courage to stand up again. The godfather's departure has always been the shadow of KD's life. After going to college, KD changed to size 35 to commemorate Craig's death at the age of 35.

And the 35th, also accompanied most of KD's career.

Fortunately, KD didn't give up basketball. In the third year of senior high school, Durant played well in Oak Hill High School, averaging 19.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game; In his senior year, KD returned to his hometown high school to play. His average field data has soared to 23.6 points and 10.2 rebounds. In the evaluation of the national scouting system, he is recognized as the second high school student. The first was a young man named Kelsi BALs III.

It seems that fate dictates that BALs is Russell Westbrook's best friend in high school and his closest comrade in arms. But later, because of heart disease, BALs died early. In memory of BALs, weishao has been wearing a bracelet engraved with his initials throughout his career.
