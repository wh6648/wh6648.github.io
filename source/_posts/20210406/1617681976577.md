On April 6, NBA officials announced that Bucks' Zhu huoledi and lone Rangers' Luca dongqiqi were elected as the best player in the East and west of last week.

Huoledi won the best of the week for the first time in his career and became the second bucks player of the season to win the best of the week after Janis adtokumbo (three times). Last week, huoledi led the bucks to a 3-1 record. During this period, he averaged 26.8 points, 8.5 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 steals, with a three-point shooting rate of 45.8%.

Hollerdy scored 20 + in all four games last week, including two double doubles in a row - 22 points and 10 assists against the Blazers and 33 points and 11 assists against the kings.

On Saturday local time, huoledi scored 33 points, a new high in a single game of the season and his highest score in a single game since March last season. It is worth mentioning that just last week, local time, hollerdy and the Bucks reached a four-year total value of up to $160 million in early renewal of the contract.

Dong Qiqi led the lone rangers to 4-0 last week. During this period, he had 28.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 6.3 assists. This is the second time that Dong Qiqi has won the best player of the week this season. He has become the third player in the history of the lone rangers who has won the best player of the week many times in a single season. The other two are Dirk Nowitzki and Josh Howard. Norodom won the best of the week in four seasons (06-07, 08-09, 09-10 and 10-11), while Howard won the best of the week in 06-07.
