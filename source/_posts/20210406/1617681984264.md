ESPN has parted ways with commentator Paul Pierce, according to reports earlier today. However, the Boston Celtics legend immediately released his immediate response to the development on personal social media. It is clear that pierce is very optimistic about the dismissal.

Last week, pierce and a number of strippers conducted a live show in his mansion and caused a sensation on social media. Including the Laker star Kyle Kuzma, the wizard star Bradley bill have responded to this. Pierce also paid the price of being fired by ESPN. However, Pierce is very optimistic about this. Today, he released a very strange video on the social media. In the video, pierce laughs and the text is also suspicious.

"Big things are coming, please stay focused and keep smiling," says Pierce.

The most puzzling is Pierce's topic tag - "the truth shall set you free". In this special situation, there are many different explanations. Is pierce saying that he is free because he has released his nature of loving parties and exotic parties? Or is he suggesting that there are other mysteries behind the story? Anyway, apart from the obvious fact that the video he uploaded is untimely, what is the implied plot? In addition, Pierce's nickname is "truth", So this tag might just be a word game.
