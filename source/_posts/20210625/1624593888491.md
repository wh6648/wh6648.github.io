June 25 news, Al - hofford returned to Boston, next he and Celtic team to complete the unfinished business.

Five years ago, hofford signed with Celtic and began his mission to help the city win its 18th NBA championship. In the first two seasons, hofford led the team close to this goal, but in the third year, the team began to retreat and failed to stand out from the second round. After the 2018-19 season, a number of key players chose to leave, including Al hofford, who went to Philadelphia last season and then to Oklahoma City.

But as the old saying goes, "once Celtic, always Celtic.". Although hofford played in Philadelphia and Oklahoma City for a short time, his heart stayed in Boston, and now he's back here.

"The culture we've built here in the past, the culture of winning and winning the 18th championship, is what really excites me and motivates me. That's what we've been working on in the past "Obviously, when I was with the team before, I didn't achieve that goal, but that time has passed and I've got the opportunity again," hofford said in an interview. For me, what I need to think about now is what kind of goal, what I can do to achieve this goal. "

It's not a new experience for hofford, because the team has his familiar teammates, as well as some coaches and management. Hofford last wore a Celtic shirt before jay brown and Jason Tatum became all stars. His last game in Boston was two weeks before Marcus smart was selected as the best defensive first team for the first time. At that time, Robert Williams was just a rookie, but now, he is a rising star. These four young people have been growing in the past two years, and hofford's return will help speed up the process.

"I'm very lucky to be back at Celtic. I think these three years (2016-2019) are great for me, but now is a new opportunity. I know it's also a big challenge, I understand, but I'm willing to take it and I'm looking forward to working with my teammates. I really believe that we can be the team we want to be. We need to get to work now and start now Hofford continued, "I've been working and I've been working in that direction. Yesterday I saw our young players in Auerbach center, grant Williams, taco Farr and others. They did a great job and that's what we're going to do. We will work hard to prepare for the next challenge. "

Despite being 35 years old, hofford said he was still at his best¡° Physically, I feel good. " Hofford said, "I'm really in good shape now. The thunder medical team and I have done an incredible job together to keep me healthy all year and keep a positive trend. So I'm very excited about my physical condition. "

At the same time, back to his place, hofford is quite excited in spirit: "after leaving, I really feel what a special place Boston is. The history of this city, everything about this team is what I really miss. Obviously, I've learned a lot here in the past, and for me, change is for the better. I'm very grateful to have a second chance to come back here, and I can continue our unfinished business
