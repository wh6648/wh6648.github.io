On June 25, the NBA playoffs continued. In the third game of the Western Conference finals, the Suns, who welcomed Paul back, lost 92-106 to the Clippers on the road, and the score was 1-2. Booker felt cold in this game. He had only 5-for-21, 3-pointer, 1-in-7, 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists, but he made four mistakes.

In the last game, under the siege of the clippers, Booker's attack was extremely difficult. After the game back to Paul, Booker didn't attack with all his strength at the beginning, but joined hands with Paul to create opportunities for his teammates. After a turn and jump shot failed, Booker continuously opened the assist mode, successively assisted Claude and Johnson with three points respectively, and then made two breakthroughs to assist Aton under the basket. The Suns' first seven goals all came from assists, of which Booker contributed four assists to help the Suns blossom.

But he couldn't feel his own shooting. He didn't go into the breakthrough horse riding archery, and he still didn't go into the stop shot. After Paul left the court, he strengthened his attack, but the three-point and stop shot still hit the iron. Booker, who lost all six shots in the first quarter, became hesitant in the second quarter. It was only after two minutes in the second quarter that he received Paul's pass in the counterattack and scored three points to break the individual scoring shortage.

But after that, he broke through and suffered from a slip in the pass, and he still didn't get in after a quick stop. Fortunately, Paul used the pass to lead the team to get the lead, and after the second quarter, he returned to the court and scored again with two free throws. At the end of the half-time, Booker finally hit an emergency stop shot again, which helped the Suns widen the difference to 6 points. In the third quarter, Booker hit a high difficulty breakthrough throw. It seems that he has recovered his state, but the situation has changed dramatically.

The Clippers made a climax of the score, and Booker also encountered a crisis in an instant. First, he was robbed by Beverly and fouled by others. Then, he was blown to block fouls when the defensive side took over the cover. Then, he got entangled with Beverly and each of them took a technical foul. In about a minute, Booker took three fouls in a row and was forced to leave the court for four times, The sun soon fell behind to double digits.

After coming back again, Booker missed the ball and hit the iron with three points. When he fell behind to 15 points, he finally made a strong layup, and then hit two free throws. After missing a three-point arc top, he caught the ball under the basket and easily scored. However, this sporadic attack failed to catch up with the score. At the end of the day, Booker was shot by a big hat when Mann's breakthrough shot in singles, and he still failed to score.

In the case of Paul's continuous attack and pass, Booker also dislocated and forced zubaz to lay up, expanding the Suns' attack climax to 12-0 to catch up with 6 points. But the momentum of chasing points did not continue, and Booker's condition did not improve. Later, he was bitten by Beverly again. Not only was his three-point shot cut off, but also he was forced to pass the ball and was sprayed with rubbish. He couldn't make a quick stop, break or throw.

The main general has not recovered the condition all the time, the sun pursues the minute momentum also to stop abruptly, has been taken away the competition by the Clippers another wave current.
