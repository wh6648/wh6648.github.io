On June 25, the NBA playoffs continued. The Suns, who welcomed Paul back in the third game of the Western Conference finals, lost 92-106 to the Clippers on the road. Paul was caught 1-2 with a big score. Paul had a bad hand. He only made 5 of 19 shots and got 15 points, 12 assists and 3 steals.

In the two games in which Paul was absent, the Suns relied on the brave performance of Booker and Aton and the team's overall tactics. However, it is obvious that the Suns without Paul are not the real suns. In this game, Paul is coming back, and his series shows the style of top masters again. On the first goal, he hit back to assist Eaton's throw, and then broke back to bridge's three-point failure and Claude's three-point jump. In the first seven goals, all of them came from assists, among which Paul contributed three assists. He and Booker joined hands to help the Suns blossom.

But like Booker, Paul's shooting hand is also very bad, the first quarter has three easy stop shot failed to hit. In the second quarter, although Paul had three assists from Booker and a layup from Johnson, he still didn't score two three points, only relying on three free throws to break the scoring shortage.

With 3:44 left in the second quarter, Paul finally stopped the shot and scored his first goal in the sports game. Then he hit another shot. Although the breakthrough shot was blocked by zubartz, he quickly assisted bridges to score three points. In the first half, although Paul was only 2-for-10, he sent out eight assists, especially in the second quarter when he constantly used assists to help the Suns respond and led the team to surpass the score in the second half.

In the third quarter, the Clippers flashed out a wave of offensive climax to surpass the score. When he was led to 7 points, Paul stepped out and made a difficult three-point dash against the defense to help the team stop bleeding. At the end of the game, Paul assisted Eaton to make a smash, and then, when Kennard knocked him to the ground, he made three difficult points. Soon, he assisted Claude to make three points, leading the Suns to make a wave of 12-0 climax, reducing the difference to 6 points.

However, he didn't continue this good state. After that, he failed to score two three points and one middle shot. Although he also assisted Eaton to lay up, he missed the dribble and lost the ball. After that, he was hit back by the clippers and scored three points, expanding the difference to 16 points. The Suns completely lost the hope of winning.
