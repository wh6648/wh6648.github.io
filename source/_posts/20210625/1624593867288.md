On June 25, according to reports from US media, NBA star Scotty Pippen said that he thought LeBron James was smarter than Kevin Durant in playing, because James would not make a draw like KD.

Talking about KD's extremely flat shot in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Pippen said: "have you ever seen LeBron shoot like this? He won't do it like this. He will play more cleverly and call for a pick and roll, which KD can't do

"KD can score more points than LeBron, but has he overtaken LeBron? No, KD tried to beat the bucks on his own instead of relying on the strength of the team. Do you see what I mean? " Pippen continued, "LeBron will come up with a way to beat [bucks], not get exhausted, he may not throw the last shot."

"In my opinion, although KD's offensive ability is really great, it's also his biggest enemy," Pippen said, "because it makes him not know how to play team basketball. KD will only attack his opponent one punch at a time."

"The conclusion is that LeBron is not KD, and KD is not LeBron."

A netizen forwarded Pippen's point of view and @ Durant, "but if KD scored a three-point shot at the last moment, maybe there would be no such topic?"

In response, KD replied on social media, "the great Pippen can't shoot at the last minute. Isn't it because he thinks his coach has made tactics for better shooters in the team?"
