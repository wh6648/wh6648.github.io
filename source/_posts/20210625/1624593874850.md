On June 25, 2021, the clipper and the sun are going west, G3 is in progress. After half-time, the clippers were 46-48 behind the suns.

In the first half of the game, clippers star Paul George played for 20 minutes and got 13 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists. This is his 16th consecutive playoff game this year.

According to statistics, George has been in full attendance so far this year's playoffs, with an average playing time of 40.7 minutes, ranking second in the League (Damien Lillard, who has only played six playoffs, ranking first in the League). In the five games in which Leonard was absent, George played 40.2 minutes, 40.4 minutes, 45.5 minutes, 39 minutes and 41.3 minutes respectively.

Although George's playoff performance has been controversial before, his average playoff output of 26.6 points, 8.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists this year is still worthy of the title of a star, and can lead the team to win four games in a row in the absence of Leonard to eliminate the western first jazz.
