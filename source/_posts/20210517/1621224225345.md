On May 17, the NBA regular season went to the last game, and the Lakers challenged pelicans away. This is the second game of James' comeback. As the Lakers want to strive to improve their ranking on the last day of the season, James' return has brought confidence to the playoffs.

Because of the strong desire to win, James took out the level of a superstar in this game, with 25 points, 6 rebounds and 3 steals.

James began with a high morale, assists pop hit three points, sounded the attack horn of the Lakers. In the first quarter, James not only connected with his teammates, but also used his personal ability to attack the basket. In the middle of the first quarter, James continuously attacked the basket and frequently used his physical advantages to open up defense. James scored 8 points in the first quarter, which shocked the whole court.

James took the lead in this game. James on the defensive side was very dazzling. At the end of the half-time, he had robbed the opponent three times. These steals not only turned into James's one-to-two fast break, but also assisted Davis's subtle air relay dunk, helping the Lakers to play a wonderful defensive counterattack.

After a week's recovery, James came back full of blood and became the leader of the team on the field. The ankle injury that once plagued him seemed to be recovering well. When people thought that James would be old, he was always able to respond to queries with brilliant performance.

In the third quarter, James's scoring momentum slowed down, but he helped his teammates to score in the beginning. Although James's sense of existence decreased in the third quarter, the whole team of the Lakers played a better overall attack and successfully opened the gap, allowing the Lakers to open the 15 point gap to enter the fourth quarter.

Although he didn't feel good in the third quarter, James took over the game at the beginning of the fourth quarter. First, he assisted Caruso, and then he scored 7 points with the help of his teammates, which stabilized the situation for the team. Finally, the Lakers won under James.

The regular season is over. Although the Lakers end with victory, because the Blazers win, the Lakers enter the playoff with the seventh place in the West and start the competition for the playoff seat as the defending champion. In the single elimination system of the playoff, how far the Lakers can go in the future depends on James' performance.

For James, the Lakers play off is a problem, the first game will face the old opponent warriors, although the Lakers are now strong, but the opponents of the Western play off area are not easy to provoke the role.

In the next game, James, who returns to the court, wants to show his emperor's strength and how to cross the playoffs to win the championship. James is writing another legend.
