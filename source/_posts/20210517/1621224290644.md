On May 17, the 2020-21 NBA regular season came to an end, and the Brooklyn nets met the Cleveland Cavaliers at home. After the whole game, the net won 123-109, locking in the second place in the East.

In this battle, Durant played efficiently. He scored 23 points, 8 rebounds and 13 assists. With a perfect performance, he finished the regular season.

At the end of the regular season, when the Cavaliers play at home, the nets are still under pressure to compete for the position. If they want to ensure the second position in the East, the nets still need to try their best to win this game.

Because of the task, Durant didn't choose to take turns this night, but devoted himself to the game at the beginning. After less than a minute and a half in the first quarter, KD hit two points with his signature backward jump shot.

But then, KD is no longer obsessed with personal attacks, as long as there is a chance, he is always the first time to pass to his teammates. In the nets team, Owen has become the biggest beneficiary of Durant's passing. He has played half a quarter, and KD's wonderful pass has helped him score three times.

In fact, in the past season, due to the frequent absences of the big three of the nets due to injuries, the chances of the three really cooperating in actual combat are not much. As for Durant, he only played 35 games in the regular season, less than half of the whole schedule. Although KD has shown amazing projection efficiency and the highest real shooting rate in his career, the nets have always been very cautious about his health.

Back in today's game, Durant sent out five assists in a single quarter, and it was not until the beginning of the second quarter that he hit another goal through a jump shot. Next, KD freely switches between organization and scoring. Obviously, when his career comes to this stage, he doesn't care much about data. Now, he plays on the field, which is obviously more free and more changeable.

Before half-time, maybe he was tired of shooting. KD suddenly turned into a basket killer. In a counterattack, he cooperated with Bruce Brown and made a smash in the air. Then, KD made another strong attack and finished it with a strong dunk. When everyone was wondering when KD was going to work, he had already scored double in silence.

Yi Bian fought again, Durant continued to play down the attack, unconsciously, he scored more than 20, not only that, in addition to personal scoring, his assists also reached 13 times, equating the personal season record.

In fact, since leaving the warriors in 2019, Durant has been looking for an opportunity to re prove his core values. For this reason, he has patiently rested in the nets for more than a year, and has patiently adjusted this season for more than a year. However, in the regular season, he has at most only produced five success forces, most of the games, due to health and other problems, he has not done his best, and rarely staged the moment of death.

But now, the regular season is over, and the nets are about to start the playoffs as second. Perhaps, for KD's state, there are still doubts from the outside world, and there are too many discussions about whether he can finish the season healthily.
