On May 17, the Nets beat the Cavaliers 123-109 at home. Carey Owen made 7-for-11 shots, 3-for-3 shots, 17 points, 6 rebounds, 2 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks in 29 minutes, with a positive and negative value of + 29.

As the league's new elite team, every move of the nets seems to be particularly eye-catching. According to a survey conducted by betonline, the U.S. sports website, the nets have replaced the Lakers as the most annoying team in the United States, which proves the strength of the nets. When many teams pay attention to ranking changes, the nets are very calm. In order to accumulate strength in the playoffs, they give players enough rest time and free space. Among the nets, Owen is the most calm. Recently, he said that "basketball is not the most important thing in the world".

Owen's behavior has aroused many people's dissatisfaction, but as long as he steps on the field, he will show his professionalism incisively and vividly. At the end of the game, facing the third from the bottom Cavaliers in the East, the net played more easily. In 9:56, Owen connected with Durant and easily put the ball into the net. Then, Owen scored two three-point goals in the outside line, leading the net to a 23-7 perfect start. With a big lead and eight minutes in the first quarter, Owen was replaced.

When the Cavaliers reduced the difference to single digits, Owen, who came back on the court, immediately stood up, took the ball to the basket and faced two defenders, throwing the ball high into the basket. After 5:28, Owen's outside line received Durant's assist and hit another three points, which led the nets to regain a double-digit lead. Seeing that the team established the advantage, Owen wanted to show off. In 2 minutes and 54 seconds, Owen made a pull bar layup under the situation of no one defending. The embarrassment was that the ball didn't give face.

In the second half of the game, because Durant's desire to attack is very strong at this time, Owen is willing to be the green leaf most of the time, and did not choose too many mobile games. Owen didn't play in the fourth quarter because of a big lead. Owen has played 54 games this season, averaging 26.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 6.0 assists.
