On May 17, the 2020-21 NBA regular season comes to an end, and the Los Angeles Lakers challenge the New Orleans pelicans away. At the end of the game, the Lakers beat pelicans 110-98, but because the Blazers also won in another field, the Lakers can only be ranked seventh and are sure to play a playoff. In the playoff, the Lakers and warriors will have a direct conversation.

This battle, the thick eyebrow elder brother hits is very relaxed, records 14 points 5 backboards.

This season, for the thick eyebrow brother is undoubtedly difficult. Because of the Achilles tendon injury, thick eyebrow rest for a long time, the whole season only played 36 regular season games.

In the absence of thick eyebrow days, the Lakers' journey has become extremely difficult. And even if he appeared in the game, many nights, his output is far lower than people expected.

As a result, during the regular season, Nongmei was criticized and questioned unprecedented since he entered the NBA. He averaged 22.1 points per game, the lowest in the past seven years. He averaged 8 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game, a new career low. This kind of output, also let the thick eyebrow elder brother oneself have no light on the face.

Can brother Nongmei get back to his peak? Are there any more games for the Lakers to defend their title? This is before the start of the playoffs, many people will inevitably have doubts.

It is an indisputable fact that thick eyebrow's career has gone into a low ebb. But the bright side of the matter is that in the sprint stage of the season, when the Lakers fell into the trap of losing, when they had trouble in the playoffs, Nongmei suddenly broke out, especially in the previous two key battles between the home court and the suns and the Knicks, Nongmei led the team with a single nucleus, and showed people his super dominance in the interior. In two games, Nongmei played 36 + 12 + 5, 42 + 12 + 5 + 3 + 3, To be the hero of the Lakers.

Almost from that moment, the purple gold army, which has been depressed for most of the season, suddenly rebounded strongly.

To the end of today's game, the Lakers have gathered a full set of starting lineup, not only thick eyebrow brother, James, Schroeder and others are all back.

In the complete lineup, brother Nongmei also has more confidence. Although this night, thick eyebrow brother's projection feel is not good, although, because winning pressure is not big, his desire to score is not strong. But he can more easily into the game, this relaxed feeling, also almost reflected in all aspects of his attack and defense.

It is undeniable that this season, brother Nongmei encountered unprecedented troubles and challenges. Unfortunately, at the end of the regular season, all the problems seem to be solved one by one.

The starting lineup of the Lakers finally got a rare chance to break in. Because of James and Schroeder's holding the ball, Nongmei no longer had to fight and attack as tired as before. But because Zhuang Shen gradually integrates, in the rebound protection, the thick eyebrow elder brother also relieved the load-bearing burden.

Today's thick eyebrow brother is more like the adhesive of the inside and outside lines, and is the light cavalry in the system. He can more freely display his talents and put most of his energy into his best scoring and basket protection. Even now, the running in of the Lakers continues. However, the training at the end of the regular season and the playoffs can help them regain their chemistry.
