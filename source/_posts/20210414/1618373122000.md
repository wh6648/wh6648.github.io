April 14 news, according to regulations, the league this season will still take the playoff system to decide the last four teams to enter the playoffs, but the Dallas Mavericks star Luca dongqiqi is very puzzled and publicly criticized. Today's lone ranger boss Mark Cuban also expressed his views on the playoff in an interview with ESPN, saying frankly that this is a huge mistake, especially considering the shrinking season of this season.

The current record of lone ranger is 29-24, ranking seventh in the western region, two wins behind the sixth pioneer in the western region. "I really don't understand the current mechanism of the league's playoffs. In the regular season, we need to play 72 games. In the playoffs, we may lose two games in a row and get out. I don't understand the significance of that." He said.

"I understand what NBA wants to do," Cuban said in an interview with ESPN today. "But if we want to play the creativity under the influence of COVID-19, the alliance should directly rank 1-20 in the record, and the top 12 will directly play the playoffs and play 13-20 additional playoffs."

"The worst thing about this approach is that it multiplies the stress of a tight schedule. Teams have to play every game to make sure they are in the top six in their division. Not for playoff seats, so they can't rotate their key players to prepare for the playoffs. As Dong Qiqi said, such a play off is meaningless, players have to play more games in a shorter time. In my opinion, it's a big mistake to put such a play off match this year Kuban continued.

"With 82 games in the regular season, we don't play more than 30 games in six weeks, so maybe it's OK." "But it's a huge mistake to compress so many games in such a short time," Kuban said. This season we have to let high utilization players rest, we have no choice, otherwise there will be serious consequences

The NBA average of 3.75 games a week after the season, however, has risen to 3.6 games a week, according to the NBA office. The lone Rangers usually give porzingis a break in back-to-back games, and Dong Qiqi occasionally takes turns.
