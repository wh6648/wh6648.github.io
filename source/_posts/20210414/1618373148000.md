On April 14, the NBA officially released its latest defensive player of the year (DPOY) list today. Top 3 remain unbeaten, still gobel, Simmons and Turner, Adebayor rose to fourth.

1. Rudy Gerber (jazz, first place last week)

What's gobel's role in the jazz? Besides scoring points, he also helps his teammates and protects the basket. Jazz coach Quinn Snyder said: "when we say win, we mean scoring and rebounding, but Gerber's game is usually about his influence on the defensive end."

2. Ben Simmons (76ers, 2nd place last week)

Simmons once again launched a shock to gobel's top position. From Simmons' point of view, he can defend multiple positions. Especially after the return of Joel enbid, Simmons has taken on a heavier task in the defensive end.

3. Miles Turner (Pacers, third place last week)

Turner hasn't played since he sprained his left ankle on April 6 local time. He missed three games. During this period, although the Pacers won three games, they lost more points per game. At present, Turner still leads the total blocking table (159) and the average blocking table (3.5 times).

4. BAM Adebayor (heat, 5th place last week)

5. Janice adtokumbo (bucks, 4th place last week)
