April 14, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continues, the Los Angeles Lakers back-to-back away challenge Charlotte Hornets. At the end of the game, the Lakers narrowly beat the Hornets 101-93, successfully avoiding a losing streak.

In this battle, Kyle Kuzma came out with injury. He felt good. He made 7 of 18 shots, hit 4 three points and got 24 points and 4 rebounds, which laid the foundation for the Lakers to win.

After yesterday's loss to the Knicks, the Lakers got into new trouble. It seems that their recent efforts in the continuation of the mental combat method have gradually lost efficacy.

Due to the lack of offensive firepower and the lack of scorers, it seems that no matter who the opponent is, the Lakers will inevitably fall into a bitter battle.

Today, the Lakers came back-to-back to Charlotte, against the young Hornets, the game is still difficult to play. What's worse, before the game, a series of Laker players appeared in the injury list.

In such a difficult matter, who will come forward to save the team?

Originally, the Lakers expected Zhuang Shen to quickly integrate into the system and play at both ends of the offensive and defensive. However, the ball, Zhuangshen half-time is still low, he again 0 points, rebounds to protect the basket contribution is also very few.

The only thing to be thankful for is that Kuzma found a sense of attack. In the first quarter, he played a clever match with Zhuang Shen and made a sharp spike after catching the ball.

Next, Kuzma scored through layups and free throws. Later in the second quarter, when the Lakers fell into a passive position, he also stood up and used continuous three-point shots to stop the purple gold.

At that time, Kuzma grabbed the rebound, quickly handed it to his teammates, and then strode forward to fight back. Kuzma ran fast enough and his teammates passed the ball in time. Although, at the moment of Kuzma's attack on the inside line, Bi Yongbo also rushed to the basket, Kuzma had already jumped up to face the opponent's defense, and he smashed the ball into the basket.

You know, recently affected by the injury, Kuzma stop and go, and has scored less than 15 points in three games. However, in this game, he got 14 points in the first half.

Also under Kuzma's drive, the Laker maintains the superiority throughout. Yi Bian fought again, Kuzma continued to hit three points and scored 20 points easily.
