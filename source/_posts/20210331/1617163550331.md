New signing Andre Drummond will appear in tomorrow's game against Milwaukee Bucks, replacing mark Gasol as starting center, Los Angeles Lakers coach Frank Vogel said in an interview today.

"I think my level of excitement is the highest ever," Drummond said in a media interview today. It's worth mentioning that this is his first full training with the team since he agreed to sign with the Lakers at the weekend.

In addition, Drummond has not participated in the competition since February 12 local time. He said that it is "Crazy" to stay away from the competition for a long time, but he is very confident of the state after his first training in Los Angeles.

"I think it's incredible that I didn't gasp." Drummond said. Earlier, Drummond revealed that he had lost 10-15 pounds while away from the court, adding: "now, I may be at my best."

Drummond, 27, will become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season and Vogel said the team intends to renew his contract with him. "That's what we want, of course, and we'll make it happen. We hope that he (Drummond) can help us in this season's championship journey. We also hope that he will be a member of the Lakers for a long time to come. That's the key person we envision in the short term and in the long term. "

In addition, according to reports earlier today, after signing Drummond, the general managers of several competitors believe that the Lakers will finally reach a buyout agreement with mark Gasol. Gasol signed a two-year $5.26 million contract with the Lakers last offseason.

Talking about little Gasol, Vogel said: "mark (Gasol) has encountered difficulties because of the health and safety agreement and other things, but he likes here very much, he is very popular in the team and everyone respects him very much. He's a real professional and he'll handle these things well. In the sprint of the playoffs, in the championship journey, we need all three centers in our team. I hope so. He is a real expert
