The Brooklyn nets superstar Kevin Durant has been absent since suffering a hamstring injury in his left leg in the game against the warriors on February 14, according to the news on March 31. But Durant will still occupy a place in the spotlight, although this is not the kind of positive publicity he wants. According to US media reports, Durant has recently been involved in a controversy on social media.

Recently, Michael Rapoport, a famous American actor, has posted a screen shot of his alleged verbal fight with Kevin Durant on social media. The text in the picture shows that there is a fierce relationship between the two. Durant humiliated Rapoport many times with the words beginning with "bit". Some words are suspected of insulting women and involving Rapoport's wife, Durant even wanted to have a fight with Yola papote.

It seems that all this comes from Durant's interview with Charles Barkley when he participated in "inside the NBA" in December last year. Durant's unfriendly attitude in the interview made Barkley very embarrassed. Later, Michael lapaport criticized Durant as "super sensitive". Durant seems to be very dissatisfied with Michael lapaport's criticism and bombards the actor in some unpleasant ways. Durant asked Michael lapaport where he lived and whether he had the ability to fight. It is reported that Michael lapaport has hired a lawyer.

Michael lapaport's post has quickly become a hot search on the Internet, and Durant has responded to it through Twitter. In a conversation with a fan, Durant claimed that his bitter quarrel with Michael Rapaport was no different.

"Michael and I often talk crazier than that. Today he's angry. I'm wrong, Mike!" Durant replied.

Later, Rapaport also made a response to Durant's comments, denying that this is a frequent occurrence between them, "No. Don't threaten me or speak ill of my wife Lapaport said.
