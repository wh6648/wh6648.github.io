On March 31, NBA officials announced the latest issue of the best defensive player of the year (DPOY) list today. In this issue's list, Gerber continues to rank first, while Simmons drops to No.3.

1. Rudy Gerber (jazz, first place last week)

As a two time DPOY winner, Gerber provided strong support to the jazz on the defensive end, which is one of the reasons why Salt Lake City led the league. In addition, the other players around Gerber, their performance in the defensive end is also remarkable.

2. Miles Turner (Pacers, third place last week)

Turner shot 24 blocks in the last five games, leading the Pacers to a 4-1 record. Turner hasn't played the game he lost. So far this season, Turner averaged 3.5 blocks per game, ranking first in the league.

3. Ben Simmons (76ers, 2nd place last week)

Enbid continues to stop injury, which requires Simmons to take more responsibility on the field. Due to the need to focus on the offensive end, Simmons' recent defensive data has declined. The 76ers get George Hill on the deadline, which will share Simmons' pressure in the back court.
