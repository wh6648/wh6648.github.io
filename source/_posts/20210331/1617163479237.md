On March 31, according to reports from the bleachers, informed sources revealed that the general manager of several rival teams believed that the Lakers would eventually reach a buyout with mark Gasol.

After the trade deadline, Andre Drummond, who completed the buyout with the Cavaliers, chose to join the Lakers. After coming to Los Angeles, "Zhuang Shen" will become the starting center.

Zhuang Shen's joining has a certain influence on little Gasol. This week he turned down an interview arranged for him by the team, not the first time the Spanish tower has refused to be interviewed this season. But it's worth mentioning that this interview was refused after the Lakers officially announced the signing of Zhuang Shen.

In the off-season last year, Gasol signed a two-year contract with the Lakers, worth $5.26 million.

However, after joining the Lakers this season, Gasol's overall performance was lower than expected. In his 38 games, he averaged 19.8 minutes, 4.8 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 blocks.

It's worth mentioning that although Gasol is older and moves slowly, he has a lot of experience in the playoffs, which is very important for those teams competing for the title.
