March 31 news, the nets team in the past two and a half months have James - harden, Blake - Griffin and LaMarcus - Aldrich to Brooklyn, now the nets really created a terror invincible warship. In an interview with the media today, Aldrich talked about the main reasons why he joined the nets. It is worth mentioning that this is his first interview after joining the nets.

"The Brooklyn nets showed their interest very quickly," Aldrich said in an interview. "Kevin Durant called me and said," I must come here, "so I waited and weighed my options. Finally, I decided to join the nets. It's a great team and I think I can definitely help. "

"A very good team", obviously, this is Aldrich's very conservative evaluation. When Kevin Durant recovers from a hamstring injury, the nets may become one of the most powerful super teams in the league history, because this team already has All-Star Kerry Owen and James Harden as backcourt partners.

In fact, the continuous operation of the nets has also aroused strong reaction from all League Fans. They have become the public enemies of the league. Aldrich said that he did not pay attention to this.

"I don't understand these things. If you've been following me all my career, you know I don't read newspaper clippings much, so I don't know anything about it. I'm just here to play basketball. I'm old now, so it's an opportunity to play in a winning team and bring something I think can help the team, that's it Aldrich continued.

Today's basketball net has become the team with the greatest chance of winning the championship. When talking about why to choose the basketball net, Aldrich said: "it's about a role. I can help the team to fill the vacancy of a big man who can both score and defend... I think this is the biggest factor. I'm not here to be an all star, I'm just trying to do what I'm good at

April 1, nets home against the Rockets, this may be Aldrich joined the nets after the first appearance.
