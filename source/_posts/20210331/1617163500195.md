On March 31, NBA reporter Bryan wenhorst reported that Dennis Schroeder had rejected a four-year, 84 million dollar early contract extension offer from the Lakers, according to informed sources.

That's an average of 21 million dollars a year. The Zijin team wanted to keep Schroeder, but Schroeder refused. His goal is to get a bigger contract this summer.

It's worth mentioning that this is the second time that Schroeder has rejected the early contract renewal offer offered by the Lakers. At the beginning of this season, the Lakers offered an early contract renewal offer of $33.4 million for two years, but Schroeder didn't accept it.

Last year off-season, the Lakers and the thunder completed a deal, Schroeder as one of the chips was sent to Los Angeles. After coming to the Lakers, Schroeder played the role of starting point guard.

In the summer of 2016, Schroeder and the Hawks signed a four-year contract extension worth $70 million. The contract is due to expire this summer and his salary is $15.5 million this season.

On the closing day of last week's trade, the Lakers had heard about Schroeder's offer, including using Schroeder as one of the chips to exchange Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry. In the end, there was no trade.
