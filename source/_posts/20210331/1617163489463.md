On March 31, NBA reporter Bryan wenhorst revealed in a podcast that he had heard that the superstar LeBron James of the Lakers had recruited the warriors star Stephen curry during this year's all star period.

This year's all star is the first time James and curry have worked together in their careers. Before that, they had never been teammates in NBA, all star games, Olympic Games and World Cup.

Although James and curry had been competing for years, they had a good private relationship. It is worth mentioning that both were born in Akron.

Curry signed a five-year $201 million super contract with the warriors in the summer of 2017. The contract, due to expire in the summer of 2022, is worth $43 million this season and $45.78 million next season.

According to the labor agreement, curry is eligible to renew his contract with the warriors in the off-season this year. Warriors general manager Bob Myers previously revealed in an interview that the team plans to extend Curry's contract ahead of schedule this summer and is optimistic that he will die in the warriors.

It is reported that the warriors can provide curry with a four-year contract with a total value of $215 million, which is valid until the 2025-26 season.
