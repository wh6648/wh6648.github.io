In recent years, Denver Nuggets have risen strongly and become a great power that can not be underestimated in the western region. Last season, Denver Nuggets even knocked out the champions, the Los Angeles Clippers led by Leonard and George, and entered the Western Conference finals. All of this is inseparable from the central role of the center from Europe's Serbia, MVP hot Nikolay Jokic.

European basketball has a significant position in the world basketball, the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Lithuania, Spain and Greece have been famous for a time (South American basketball, Argentina, Brazil's style is close); compared with the United States basketball, European basketball pays more attention to team cooperation and ball transfer, and more attention to shooting and three-point. Since the 21st century, with more and more international players entering the NBA (now accounting for more than 20%), plus the active introduction of spurs coach Popovich and warriors coach Cole, the concept of European basketball has been transplanted into the NBA, and both spurs Dynasty and warriors Dynasty can vaguely see the appearance of European basketball. In the history of Europe, there have been top centers such as "roof of the world" sabonis, "veteran" Divac, etc., and joachi's ability of coordination and organization is better than others, so he is worthy of being the first organization center in history.

Under the guidance of Mike Malone, the team plays team attack based on the double core "Errenzhuan" of joachi and Murray, with strong style and strong discipline. Nuggets pay attention to the transfer of the ball, cover, air cut and run back to get scoring opportunities, we all participate in the team attack. This set of play is quite European (South American) basketball break zone attack style. Flex offense, also known as the broken line attack, is an attack system that appeared in Europe and South America in the 1970s. Through the broken line cutting into the interior line, corner position or three-point line, we can get scoring opportunities. In 2004, coach Ruben magnano led Ginobili and Scola's Argentin team to win the Athens Olympic championship, relying on this kind of playing method.

Jojic is the core of the team, responsible for organizing and controlling the court. He began to practice basketball hard at the age of 14 (before he was interested in horse racing), but showed amazing talent. He has textbook like offensive skills and game reading ability, can have the ball, can have no ball, can be low, can be high, can carry the body, can face the basket, can hook, can jump shot, can lay up, can cover, can grab the board, Can coordinate and even dribble through the half court organization, attack range from the inside to the three-point line. Murray is in charge of cutting points. He has an all-round attack, can be inside and outside, can have the ball, can not have the ball, can stop jump shot and catch the ball, and can break through the basket. Nuggets have plenty of physical fitness, can carry a long playing time, and big heart scoring ability and scoring explosive power in key games.

Porter relies on the ability of fixed-point strong shooting and the ability of rolling attack under the basket, showing good offensive firepower, just like the team is in charge of three. Team Barton, Morris and campazo shared the organizational pressure, team double nucleus, Porter, Millsap, Morris, Barton, campazo and green have a good three-point shooting rate.

Nuggets usually use one inside, four outside or five outside teams to attack in the discount area. When one of the two cores holds the ball, the team members run in the discount area for the team-mates through the lower cover, the back cover, the cross cover, the cover for the screen person, and then cut and run back, and then add the transfer ball to create the chance of more play, less dislocation or vacancy.

Joachi's holding is the Nuggets' first tactic. Joachi can stand in the paint area, the top of the arc, the free throw area, the elbow area, the corner and the low position, and even hold the ball for half time. He watches the situation in the field and looks for space to attack. Teammates (mainly Murray) run around Jokic, or catch the ball or tear the defense. Jokic drives the whole team to attack with sharp and accurate passing, including long pass, short pass and hand over. Joachi averaged 8.6 assists per game, including 1.9 assists for Murray and 1.5 assists for porter. When necessary, Jokic can also take over the game in singles. He uses the external projectiles to make the slow-moving heavy center full of holes, and uses the internal singles to make the fast-moving light center full of flesh and blood. Last season, both zubaz and Harrell were beaten to ashes by joachi. Today, only a few centers such as Howard can limit joachi in the league.

Hand in hand passing is an important scoring method for nuggets, which accounts for 6.1% of the total score and can get 6.7 points per game, ranking fifth in the league. This is a good skill of Jokic, and the defenders can also cooperate with each other. Nuggets by hand score more players are Murray, kampazo and porter.

The Nuggets sometimes use Murray to hold the ball and play pick and roll with joachi. Joachi has good quality of pick and roll. After pick and roll, he can not only get rid of the running position and cut in the shot, but also shoot three points from the outside. However, pick and roll is not an important means of nuggets. According to statistics, Nuggets rely on pick and roll 23.8 times (league 24) and score 23.6 points (league 22).

This season, due to the departure of grant, pramley and Craig, the team's attack and defense have been weakened. Fortunately, with the European basketball attack system, the Nuggets still have a good record. Limited by the athletic ability of Jokic, the team reduced the number of attack rounds (97.7 per game, 28th in the League), focused on positional attack, ensured the success rate of attack, and the team hit rate was 48.7% (4th in the League). The team rarely plays fast break, averaging 11.9 per game (18th in the League). Denver Nuggets have a relatively balanced score in the paint area of the interior line, the central position and the three-point position. This season, due to the quality improvement of the shooting team, the three-point shooting rate is 38.6% (the 5th in the League), which is much better than last season (35.9%, the 15th in the League).

In addition, Denver, where the Nuggets are located, is at a high altitude (5883 feet, and Salt Lake City, which is also at a high altitude, 4227 feet). The air on the plateau is thin, which reduces the aerobic circulation of the players. It has always been called the devil's home, which is the opponent's nightmare. This is the guarantee of the Nuggets' home performance (according to research and statistics, the Nuggets' ball Stadium (formerly known as Pepsi Center) has nearly two-thirds of the chance to kill the opponents who are comparable).

However, the departure of grant, pramley and Kroger has a great influence on the defensive end of the team, and the defensive defects of Jokic are even more exposed. The team makes up for Jokic's defects of blocking and rolling by changing defense or big delay, and that's all. The team's defensive efficiency is 112 (19th in the League), which becomes the weakness of nuggets. The decline on the defensive side means that the team has to take more points from the offensive side to make up for it. This season, like last season, Jokic can't be lazy and skilful in the regular season to maintain his physical fitness, so as to overcome the difficulties in the playoffs. In the regular season, Jokic also has to contribute his firepower output, slashing 27.2 points + 11.1 boards + 8.6 assists, high-level data per as high as 31.8, obpm as high as 9.5, ows as high as 8.2, ranking first in the league and becoming the most popular MVP. Denver's defensive defects are exactly the reason why the team traded Gordon and McKee (and added Clark) during the trading period.
