On July 7, the NBA finals of the 2020-21 season began. The Suns played at home against the Bucks, and the Bucks lost 105-118 to the Suns, trailing 0-1. Middleton played well in the game, shooting 12 of 26, 3-pointer, shooting 5 of 12, 29 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists, while Huo ledi felt cold, shooting 4 of 14, getting 10 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists.

After the return of brother Letterman, the performance of the Bucks' two main generals was obviously affected. Middleton didn't feel good when he came up. He didn't score in either the middle shot or the three-point shot or the layup. He only hit one middle shot in the first five shots. Although after that he raced to catch up with three points, but he failed to get back to his state. In the second quarter, he lost three goals in a row, and the Bucks' attacking efficiency dropped sharply and was pulled back to the score.

When the difference came to 7 points, Middleton finally began to show some performance. Lopez, who had a pick and roll assist, made a smash in the air, followed by his own three-point pursuit, and soon with the help of a cover throw, helped the Bucks make a wave of 7-0 equalizing score. After the Suns took the lead again, he also made Booker's offensive fouls on the defensive end. Middleton's performance of this wave is quite excellent. But he was even better in the second half of the third quarter.

In the third quarter, he failed in two attacks again. When the difference was pulled to 18 points, Middleton first made three points, then swung to Craig's throw and hit, and then faced Craig's two long-range shots. Although the Suns' attack was efficient and maintained a lead of about 20 points, Middleton's continuous scoring made a good response and failed to make the difference further opened, He won all 10 points in the last three minutes of bucks by himself.

At the end of the game, the Bucks launched a final counterattack, and Middleton continued his excellent state. He made two attacks, turned around to score, and assisted Forbes to score three points. He led the bucks to narrow the difference to seven points. But at this time, Middleton made mistakes one after another, first breaking through the pass mistakes, and then being robbed face to face by Paul, Although he quickly responded with a strong throw, he failed to score the next three points and the Bucks failed to narrow the difference again.

Huo ledi was also greatly affected. Because he didn't have the right to the ball, Huo ledi didn't show any performance for a long time after the game started. Although he gradually began to attack with the progress of the game, he didn't hit the outside line, under the basket or in the middle shot. All the four shots in the first quarter hit the iron, but the passing was still good. Lopez made a layup with a long pass, Excellent assists Tucker into the layup, but also in the counterattack assists Portis layup, a single quarter sent out four assists, a good series of the team.

In the first half of the second quarter, Paul scored his first goal, then made a quick stop shot near the free throw line, and also made a dunk in the big open space under the basket, which made his performance a little warmer. But after that, he made a series of mistakes. When he was eight points behind, he made a pass mistake, failed to make a layup, and lost the ball in the breakthrough. In the third quarter, he was robbed again to fight back. He still didn't score one three points and two midshots, and the difference became bigger and bigger. When he fell behind to 14 points, he relied on the counterattack to score a goal.

At the end of the game, in the Bucks' counterattack, Huo ledi finally made a contribution. He assisted Connaughton to score three points, and then hit two free throws. He also helped the bucks to chase the difference to 11 points. However, after that, there were few opportunities for performance, and the key corner of the last two minutes was still three minutes away. The whole game huoledi's hand is very cold, although his passing is still very good to help his teammates, but the personal dumb fire is difficult to help the team win.
