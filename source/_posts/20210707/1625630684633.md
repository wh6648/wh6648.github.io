On July 7, according to official news, ESPN hostess Rachel Nichols was withdrawn from this year's NBA Finals for her racial remarks about female colleague Maria Taylor in private. Her job was replaced by another hostess, Marika Andrews.

In today's program, Rachel apologized for her leaked call. Last July, Rachel inadvertently made a call with the camera on, and the video was transmitted to the company's control center. She said Taylor was chosen as the host of last year's Finals because the TV station was under pressure to address its "long-term bad ethnic diversity.". Ben cafado, senior director of ESPN communications, said in a statement that it was "the best decision of all concerned to keep everyone focused on the NBA Finals" for Rachel not to be a sideline reporter

On Monday, the New York Times published a sensational report detailing the accidental recording of Rachel Nichols' July 2020 conversation with Adam Mendelssohn, James' adviser. During the call, Rachel hints to Mendelssohn, who is also white, that Taylor has the chance to host the 2020 NBA Finals because she is black, and that position was originally owned by Rachel.

Rachel said on the phone, "guess what's clearing the way? Let Maria host it full time. I wish Maria Taylor every success. She covers football and basketball. If you need to give her more work just because you're under pressure to maintain this terrible long-term racial diversity, do it. I know what's going on myself, by the way

"But you won't take what belongs to me." Said Rachel Nichols.

Mendelssohn responded, "I don't know. I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted by black lives matter and metoo."

The conversation was filmed and sent to the main control room of ESPN. The tape quickly spread around ESPN, which reported that it had never punished Rachel for her comments on Taylor over the phone.

Just a few hours before the finals, ESPN announced that Rachel would not appear on the sidelines of the finals for coverage, or on "NBA countdown," which is the pre match and midfield show of the finals. Taylor is expected to host the show with other NBA reporters.

ESPN also announced that Marika Andrews, who is also a black woman and one of the top media figures in the Forbes sports industry's "30 under 30" list, will be in charge of coverage during the finals.

In today's show the jump, Rachel Nichols apologized for her remarks.

"The first thing that journalism school teaches you is not to be a news person. I don't want to break this rule today, and I don't want to distract you before a wonderful NBA Finals, but I don't want to let this moment go by and say something that doesn't matter how much I respect and cherish ESPN colleagues." "I'm very sorry for the people I've hurt, especially Maria Taylor, and I'm really grateful to be part of this great team," she said

Maria Taylor has yet to comment publicly on the New York Times article or Rachel's apology.

In the NBA Finals G1 pre match press conference, NBA president Adam Xiaohua made a response to the matter: "they are excellent in each other's fields of work, this is a very unfortunate situation, two women are competing with each other."

Adam Mendelssohn, who spoke to Rachel, also apologized by email: "rooted in my privilege, I made a stupid and careless comment. I'm really sorry for that. I shouldn't have said that, or even thought that. I am committed to supporting these movements, and I know that people affected by these problems will never be exhausted or have nothing. I have to continue to check my privileges and try to be a better ally. "
