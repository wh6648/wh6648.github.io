On July 7, the Suns beat the Bucks 118-105 at home. Devon Booker made 8 of 21 shots, 1 of 8 three-point shots, 10 of 10 free throws, contributed 27 points, 2 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals, with a positive and negative value of + 18. It is worth mentioning that Booker and Chris Paul (32 points) scored 59 points in their debut in the NBA finals. They also became the starting backcourt combination that scored the most points in their debut in the NBA finals. The previous record was maintained by the 76 man backcourt combination Iverson and Aron McKee in 2001.

In the first five seasons of Booker's career, he has been known as the cancer of the team, because in his absence, the positive and negative value of the Suns per 100 rounds is higher than when he was there. With the arrival of Chris Paul, although Booker's basic data did not improve, his importance in the game has been a qualitative leap. For Booker, the happy thing is that he can reach the finals in the playoffs for the first time in his career. In addition, in the Western Conference finals G2, Booker suffered a nasal bone fracture, and in the following several games, he was wearing a mask. However, he took off his mask in the finals.

As "Kobe's disciple", Booker's basketball strength is beyond doubt. After the start of the game, Booker quickly launched a personal offensive and became the team pioneer, breaking the Bucks' defense line in a row and sending the ball into the net. The most wonderful scene happened in the first quarter with 6 minutes and 17 seconds left. In the counterattack, Booker broke through to the basket with the ball and hit the left hand layup in the air in the face of 3-man defense. Bucks whether it is to send big Lopez or Forbes defense, obviously can not stop Booker forward, the latter also frequently stand on the free throw line. In the second quarter, with 8 minutes and 24 seconds left, Booker made his debut again. After coming up, he made a decisive jump shot to hit the ball, and then assisted Paul to hit three points. The unstoppable Booker has 16 points.

In the second half of the game, Booker didn't have a strong desire to attack. In 6:55, Booker took the ball and shot, and huoledi immediately killed to make up the defense, but Booker stretched out his foot in the air and tripped huoledi. After Booker got the ball, the referee whistled, blew a foul and the goal was invalid. With the deepening of the game, the physical confrontation between the two sides has become more intense. In 1:41, when Booker broke through to the basket to attack, he was pulled down directly by Connaughton and fell out of the bottom line. Booker made two free throws. At this time, the sun has expanded its advantage to 20 points.

Booker made an appearance in 7:46 before the final game, but he made a mistake and was robbed by Middleton. But Booker was later redeemed by three points from the outside. 4 minutes and 1 seconds, Buck received Paul's pass and hit the jump shot, ending the Bucks' 7-0 attack. In the end, the Suns beat the bucks to win the finals series.
