On July 7, the NBA Finals began, and the Suns played the bucks at home. Brother letterman's comeback with injury has become the focus of the whole court, and his teammates have also played a beautiful performance led by the competitive brother Letterman. At the beginning, big Lopez continuously received the ball under the basket and scored, which has brought down the power of Aton.

Big Lopez continued the excellent performance when he was not in the East finals. His height became the secret weapon of the Bucks, causing chaos in the Suns' penalty area. In the first quarter, he repeatedly grabbed offensive rebounds, destroying the Suns' counterattack rhythm.

In the first quarter, Lopez played 8 minutes and got 7 points and 3 rebounds, including the Bucks' only 2 points and 1 / 3. He and the letter brother in the restricted area let the sun difficult to resist.

At the beginning of the second quarter, Tucker showed his outstanding green leaf nature. First, he hit an important three-point in the bottom corner, then turned back, and continuously dislocated Paul and Aton on the defensive end. He withstood the pressure in the four minutes when the Bucks played a small team, until Lopez came on the court again.

But the first quarter is the big Lopez, the second quarter back into a loophole, Paul and Booker see big Lopez on the stage, seize his weakness of slow-moving, continuous dislocation, one hit, one score, forcing the bucks to shout a pause. After the time-out, the Bucks made some adjustments. Tucker stepped up his defense and helped the Bucks keep the link without the letter brother, so that the Bucks would not lose too many points until the letter brother returned to the field.

Big Lopez was gradually targeted by Paul. In the third quarter, Paul made more efforts to focus on the weakness of Lopez's slow movement in singles. Big Lopez really suffered in front of Paul. However, although big Lopez lost points on the defensive side, the offensive side was still trying to help the team, protecting the back court rebounds, rushing to grab the front court rebounds, and suddenly applying cold arrows outside the three-point line.

In the third quarter of 8:15, after bridges scored the goal to improve the morale, Lopez responded to the three points to stop the bleeding for the bucks. Seven minutes and 11 seconds, big Lopez scored another three points to help the Bucks not be too far behind by the sun.

But as the sun's attack and defense speed increased, the Bucks' only height advantage disappeared. Although big Lopez got 17 points, the Bucks were forced to withdraw big Lopez and fight with a small team. However, the contribution of Portis was mediocre. The offensive end could not use the high threat basket like big Lopez, and the defensive end was also punished one-on-one by dislocation. The Bucks had no extra cards to try in this situation.

But when everyone felt that the sun was locked in the victory, the Bucks began to recover in the fourth quarter. In 11:14, Connaughton hit three points. Then Middleton led the bucks to fight back. In 7:46, Forbes shot three fast break points, and the difference narrowed to 9 points.

When the pitchers lost touch, the Bucks soon lost the initiative, and the Suns opened the gap again.

In the first game of the finals, the Suns beat the Bucks 118-105. The Bucks' role players couldn't play satisfactorily. The substitutes only got 10 points in the first three quarters. The important substitutes Portis and Connaughton didn't have outstanding performance. If they didn't feel warmer in the fourth quarter, Forbes would have made little contribution.

The Bucks need other players to stand up, otherwise it is difficult to find a way to win in the match with the suns.
