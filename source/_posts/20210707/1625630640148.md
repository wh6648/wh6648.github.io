Paul extended his fiery touch to the second half and hit a goal. 10 minutes and 17 seconds, the attack time was running out. Paul shot three points from the outside line against big Lopez, stepped on big Lopez's foot when he fell down, and Paul covered his left ankle with a very painful expression. After the referee looked back at the video, he called the big Lopez intentionally as a stepping stone, which was upgraded to a malicious foul, and Paul made a penalty hit. It is worth mentioning that the broadcast directly replays the series match between the warriors and Spurs - paculia's footstep against Leonard, which changed the whole series. Fortunately, Paul didn't get in the way. When the Bucks began to chase points, Paul came out again and defended the Suns' lead with a stable CIC.

The Suns expanded their advantage to as much as 18 points, and there was a deafening MVP cheering.

With 10 minutes and 17 seconds left in the last quarter, Paul is back on the stage.
