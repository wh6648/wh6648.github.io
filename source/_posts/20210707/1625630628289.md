On July 7, the 2020-21 NBA Finals began. Phoenix Suns host the first game of the series against Milwaukee Bucks. At the end of the game, the Suns beat the Bucks 118-105, leading 1-0.

The first game of the finals, bucks and the sun are obviously still in the exploratory stage, especially the Bucks side, due to the letter brother's injury, their platoon arrangement is a little stiff.

Although, after the start of the game, the letter brother suddenly announced his comeback with injury, which more or less caught the sun by surprise, but also boosted the Bucks team's morale. But from the actual combat effect, the combat power of the letter brother, especially the offensive combat power is far from the best.

As a result, the Bucks quickly fell into a passive position after a short lead was established in the first quarter. On the one hand, their offensive output could not be full. On the other hand, in defense, budenhower also felt the stones and tried all the time.

In the first half of the game, the Bucks used their defensive ace tucker to limit the Suns' control of Paul. It is undeniable that Tucker has a close relationship with Paul, and he is very familiar with the style of his old teammate. It's just that, for most of his career, Tucker is good at wrestling with his opponent's body. When Paul controls the ball, his simple and artistic playing style makes it impossible for tucker to exert his ruthlessness.

From the beginning of the second quarter, Paul's seemingly light jump shot hit again and again. Around him, Booker, bridges, Cameron Johnson and others also used similar ways to attack the bucks. In the third quarter, Paul took over the attack and shot artillery fire, and the difference quickly came to the 20 level.

Undeniably, in the face of the sun's attack, the Bucks also made some adjustments. Huoledi became the main defender of Paul in the second half. After the inside line was attacked by Eaton in succession, the Bucks gradually gave up the small team with limited efficiency and returned to the normal match.

But obviously, the Bucks did not do their best in terms of the strength and timeliness of the adjustment. They still have a lot of room for deployment, waiting for the next game to play.

In the first game of the finals, the Bucks lost without much suspense. But for them, the only good news is that the letter brother at least stood on the field, and from the strength of fighting and running, he recovered much better than expected.

However, every point in the final stage must fight, although the Bucks have the courage to make adjustments in the next game, but in the case of losing one game first, the Bucks must have some sense of urgency. Frankly speaking, the rhythm of the G1 game is completely controlled by the sun, and the defensive intensity of the game does not have much of the texture of the finals.
