On July 7, the NBA Finals began. The Suns played the bucks at home. The Suns were all in order, but the Bucks used air cutting and eating cakes under the basket to score and quickly took the lead.

Although the Suns have no advantage under the basket, they gradually pull back their height disadvantage through speed. Booker, who scored 12 points in the first quarter, first uses his personal ability to score to attract defense, and then drives other players to play aggressively.

In the first quarter of 5:39, bridges fast break dunk, the sun began to take the initiative in the scene, the attack and defense speed to the standard of our side. 3:30 seconds, Booker assists Cameron Johnson to hit three points. In the next round, Booker assists Penn to score three points in the fast break. The Suns also draw the difference at the moment, forcing the bucks to call a pause.

The sun found an advantage in the process of speed-up. Booker led Penn and Cameron Johnson to make a fierce fast break. Penn kept using his breakthrough to disturb the Bucks' defense. Cameron Johnson relied on his excellent projection ability to open space for the sun. The Bucks could only use a small team to meet, offsetting the high advantage of Lopez.

The Suns not only found the rhythm of attack by speeding up, but also used the ability of Aton and Claude to block the attack of Letterman. The second quarter is the contribution of Aton and Claude in the defensive end, so that the sun can open the difference and play the lead.

Aton is not afraid of the Bucks' change of defense, nor is he afraid of the letter brother's breakthrough. In the second quarter of 3 minutes and 12 seconds, the letter brother staggered to face Aton, but he can only throw a cold arrow out of the three-point line instead of facing Aton. In 2 minutes and 47 seconds, Letterman found a chance to play Claude, but the experienced Claude stood down to meet letterman's breakthrough. The confrontation made Letterman unable to score easily, while Letterman could only attack Claude. Finally, the referee called Letterman for offensive foul.

Bridges also played a key role in the process of the sun's acceleration. At the end of the second quarter, he grasped the opportunity of counterattack continuously to complete the points. In 1:37 seconds, he caused a foul, 2 free throws and 1:02 seconds, he threw a three-point ball to expand the difference. At this time, the sun was 8 points ahead of the bucks. Although he was blocked in the fast break, it didn't affect his contribution to the team.

In the third quarter of 9:43, bridges finished the snatch and launched a fast break, then quickly scored 2 points to help the sun hit the attack wave again. In 8:33, bridges scored 3 points with Paul's assist, at this time, the sun was 14 points ahead of the bucks.

The sun's offensive end was full of wind and water, and then it was Eaton's turn to attack. The Bucks focused on Paul's defense. Eaton began to keep moving to find a vacancy, and played with Paul's internal and external cooperation. At 6:28, Eaton received Paul's air relay dunk and scored 6 points in a row.

In 5 minutes and 37 seconds, Claude showed his defensive experience again. He successfully cut the ball against Middleton, and the ball finally bounced to Middleton's feet to get the ball back for the suns.

In the fourth quarter, due to the sun's lax defense, the point difference was once reduced to 9 points by the Bucks, but after Aton came on the court, he regained control of the situation, and several pitchers also used their projection ability to re open the offensive space. The sun quickly re opened the point difference, extinguished the Bucks' counterattack momentum, and firmly grasped the initiative in his own hands.

The Suns won the first game of the finals, beating the Bucks 118-105. Paul and Booker performed excellently, while other suns players also performed excellently. Eaton had 22 points and 19 rebounds, bridges had 14 points, Penn had 10 points and Johnson had 10 points and 3 rebounds. Claude made 0-for-8 shots, but he played a great role in defense.

The victory of the Suns is not only the excellent performance of the core, but also the unity of all the players.
