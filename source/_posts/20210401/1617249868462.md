April 1 news, from the "the Olympic" well-known reporter Samas - chalaniya reported that informed sources revealed that the Clippers plan to sign full free agent demakus - cousins.

Cousins is currently in Los Angeles for testing under the NBA health and safety agreement. The source said the two sides are discussing a 10 day short contract, but the Clippers are not expected to make a formal decision until next week.

It's worth mentioning that cousins played with Rajan Lando for pelicans and kings, and played with Patrick Patterson for kings and Kentucky University.

Last year's off-season, the rockets and corhines signed a one-year contract without guarantee. In late February of this year, after the non guarantee contract was converted to full guarantee, the Rockets announced the dismissal of koshins. This means that koshins got the full amount of $2.3 million after he was laid off.

According to previous rumors, after the trade deadline, a number of teams have expressed interest in koshins, including Celtic.

This season, koshins played 25 games for the Rockets, averaging 9.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists.
