Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James confirmed today that he has increased his stake in Liverpool and will become a partner of Fenway sports group (FSG).

In fact, James has invested in Liverpool before. In 2011, he paid $6.5 million to buy a 2% stake in Fenway sports' football club Liverpool, which is now worth $52 million, according to estimates of relevant institutions. Now, James has increased his stake in Premier League team Liverpool. It is worth mentioning that not long ago, James and his manager maverick Carter bought shares of MLB Boston Red Sox.

Fenway Sports Group announced today that it will sell 10% of its shares to red bird investment for 538 million pounds (US $750 million) and welcome LeBron James, maverick Carter and Paul Wachter as partners. The money will be used to make up for the club's financial loss of up to 120 million pounds during the epidemic period and speed up the expansion plan of Anfield Road. The club has proposed to build a new stand at Anfield to increase the capacity of the stadium to 61000 people.

In a joint statement, John W. Henry, chairman Tom Werner and President Mike Gordon, the main owners of Fenway sports group, said: "our cooperation with LeBron James, maverick Carter and Paul Wachter has lasted for 10 years. Their participation is an important milestone for Fenway sports group and will deepen the long-term friendship and relationship between the two sides since 2010. For all our fans and supporters, victory will continue to be our total motivation. As an organization, the development of Fenway sports group enables us to further strengthen our team members and commitment to the communities we serve. We look forward to these talented new partners joining us in the next chapter of Fenway Sports Group's development. "

"Through our cooperation in the past 10 years, LeBron James and I have learned a lot about business, and we believe that this will bring greater achievements," said Carter, assistant to LeBron James in a statement. We are proud to be part of this iconic group and excited by the opportunities that come with it that will continue to bring change and empower people of all races, genders and backgrounds to be part of the changing times.
