On April 1, ESPN host and commentator Stephen A. Smith said on the program "first take" that he respected the wizard star Russell Westbrook very much, but the latter's data is no longer important, whether he can win the championship is the most important.

In the last 104-114 loss to the Hornets, Westbrook scored 22 points, 15 rebounds and 14 assists, the first 20 + 15 + 14 figure in the history of the Wizards. What's more, Westbrook averaged 25.3 points, 16 rebounds and 15 assists in the past three games. He became the second player in history to average 25 + 15 + 15 in three games after Chamberlain in 1968.

Although Westbrook's data are dazzling enough, Stephen A. Smith, a famous mouthpiece, has given a blunt criticism. A-smith first praised Westbrook's achievements on the field and what he has done for the community, but then said that these data are not important, whether he can win the championship is the most important. A-smith stressed Westbrook's poor performance in the playoffs, had the opportunity to partner with superstars such as Kevin Durant, James Harden and Paul George, and reached the Western Conference finals four times, but never won the championship.

Westbrook also hit back at a-smith. "I've been playing, as my wife said, and it's important not to let people get in the way of your goals and plans, your destiny. The championship will not change my life, I am very happy now, before entering the NBA, I got the championship, I grew up in the street, I am a champion. NBA championship is not necessarily a necessity. I know many champions never do anything for the community or the people in the world Westbrook said.

"One thing I won't allow to happen again is to let people make up stories and constantly talk about me with a bunch of rubbish for no reason. To be honest, it's been like this all my career. No other player will continue to be attacked like me Said Westbrook.
