On April 1, 2021, the Rockets lost 108-120 to the nets. Harden scored 17 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists. In the fourth quarter, he didn't play because of a hamstring injury.

I don't know if the Rockets are excited when they see harden. After the opening, the Rockets even hit a climax, leading the nets by 18 points. And harden is caught by all kinds of bags, one-on-one defense is Bradley to defend harden. But even so, harden still through personal breakthrough, constantly throwing hit. In the last 0.9 seconds of the first quarter, in the face of Bradley's close defense, harden made a foul with fake action and made three free throws.

In the first quarter, although the nets did not perform well, harden still scored 14 points and three assists. In the second quarter, harden's one-on-one defense against the Rockets began to exert his power, constantly punishing Silas's defensive strategy with breakthrough. From the initial 2 + 1 layup to continuous outburst points, the nets finally recovered their rhythm when harden led the team alone in the second quarter. However, the Rockets then hit the climax again, leading to 17 points, Silas may be too familiar with the rhythm and way of harden, is to cut off the contact between him and his teammates.

In the second quarter of 8 minutes, harden finally found the opportunity again, a throw style pass assists Clarkston dunk. Of course, recently, harden's three-point break-up feeling and shots have indeed decreased. After leaving the Rockets, harden's three-point threat has dropped sharply, from 4 points per game before to 2.9 points per game. Seven minutes in the third quarter, harden assists Jordan to eat cake again in the March. After this dunk, the net has caught up to six points.

But after the fourth quarter, harden didn't play because of a hamstring injury. This season, harden averaged 36.2 minutes in the Rockets, and nearly 39 minutes in the net, ranking first in the league. So the hamstring injury of harden in this game may also remind Nash that how to use harden is one of the most important topics in the second half of the net.
