On May 26, according to the famous reporter shams charania, the sources revealed that the Charlotte Hornets plan to implement the team options of next season under the coach James Borrego contract.

This is Borrego's third season in charge of the Hornets. The team finally ranked 10th in the East with a 33-39 record, but lost to the Indiana Pacers in the playoffs. Borrego led the Hornets to a total of 95-124 in these three years.

Borrego signed a four-year contract with the Hornets in 2018, becoming the first full-time Latino coach in NBA history. Previously, he has been assistant coach for many years for the New Orleans pelicans, San Antonio Spurs and Orlando Magic.

In 2015, after the Orlando Magic fired Jacques Vaughn, Borrego worked there as a temporary coach for 30 games, but he was eventually replaced by Scott Skiles. In fact, Borrego is also a two time NBA champion. In 2005 and 2007, he assisted Greg Popovich to win two NBA championships.
