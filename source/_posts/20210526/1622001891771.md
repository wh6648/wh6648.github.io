On May 26, NBA officials announced today that New York Knicks player Julius Randall won the award of the fastest growing player of the 2020-21 season.

"I just want to say thank you to all the people involved," Randall said in an interview. "I mean, it's really a team effort. Everyone in the Knicks, from top to bottom, I thank them very much. All my teammates, they trust me and give me strength. I'm grateful to them for allowing me to be the leader of the team. And my family, my wife, my son, everyone. Everyone is helping me to be the best myself on and off the pitch

"We all know, especially in New York, that when you're not ready for a challenge, it's going to be very difficult for you. Last year, no matter from the personal or team point of view, they did not achieve the effect they want, so I want to be better in this season Randall continued.

Randall's son kyden surprised his father after the Knicks training today. Kyden personally handed the trophy of the fastest growing Player Award in 2020-21 season to his father Randall.

Randall hit 168 three-point goals in the first six seasons of his career, with a shooting rate of only 29.5%. But when playing for the Knicks this season, Randall averaged 5.5 shots from the three-point line and hit 160 three-point goals. Randall also thanks Pelican coach Alvin Gentry, who gave him the chance to extend his range to the outside. Randall said he told him he could shoot and hoped he would start shooting more three-point shots.

"For me, that's what I really want to hear," Randall says. "In a way, it's a way to boost confidence, but it's also like," Hey, this is an opportunity, this is what I want. " It really started there, and then, last year, my shooting percentage was very low, so I was able to clean up some things this year and continue to expand and build, and I know I can do things. In this alliance, a lot of things are about opportunities, confidence and mentality. "

Randall has only 3.1 assists per game, so some people label him as a selfish player. In response, Randall said: "I know myself, I know my character has nothing to do with it. I have never thought of doing anything for myself, or feeling selfish, or feeling that I can't let the people around me show the best. So it's a learning experience and I want to come back and be a better teammate and leader

It is worth mentioning that Randall became the first person to win the award of the fastest growing player in the history of the Knicks team since the award was established in 1985. Like Milwaukee Bucks' letter brother adtokumbo and Denver Nuggets' Jokic, he is the only player to lead the team in scoring, rebounding and assists this season.

"That's cool. That's cool." Randall said, "especially for a team, a team with such a long history and legend. It's cool to be number one in everything. It's a milestone for me, but I just want to move on and make progress, to see how far I can push myself as an individual, to see how far I can lead the team as a leader, that's all
