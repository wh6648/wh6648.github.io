Dallas Mavericks star christaps polzinkis has been fined $50000 for violating the league's health and safety agreement, NBA chief operating officer Byron Spruell announced today.

During the new coronavirus pandemic, the NBA banned players from entering "any bar, club, nightclub and other similar places", regardless of whether the players were vaccinated with the new coronavirus¡° Kristaps polzinkis went to and from a club on May 23 local time in the United States. However, after consulting medical experts and analyzing the facts, he did not cause any risk associated with the spread of the new coronavirus, so he did not need to be isolated. " The NBA said in a statement.

Later, NBA spokesman Mike buss also explained the difference between polzingis and Laker superstar LeBron James' violations. "I can understand the comparison between this incident and other players' violations, including LeBron James, but the nature of the two is different. LeBron James took part in a short outdoor activity involving personal business activities, in which all the people present were asked to get the new crown vaccine or the new crown negative test results. The alliance will review every possible violation and decide whether to isolate and punish according to the specific circumstances of the incident. " Mike buss said.
