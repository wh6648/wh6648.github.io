On May 26, the NBA playoffs continued. Celtic lost 108-130 to the nets, 2-0 in the series.

In this game, Tatum made 3 of 12 shots, scored 9 points, 4 rebounds and 1 assist. He suffered eye stab in the third quarter, so he had no choice but to withdraw from the game ahead of time.

After Brown's absence, Tatum had to carry the green army attack flag alone. But in the first game of the series, the key care of the nets made Tatum only hit 6 times in 20 shots, which also became one of the main reasons for losing the first game. Strong adjustment ability is an important standard to judge the level of a star. Whether Tatum can adjust in time will determine his position in the league and also the decisive factor affecting the trend of the series.

As soon as the game came up, Tatum took advantage of TT's hand-in-hand backward step to make a three-point hit. He thought this was a sign of his recovery, but the nets immediately strengthened their marking on Tatum. Tatum's state was not good. Under the strict defense of the nets, the offensive initiative was not strong. In the first quarter, only these three points were scored, and the rest of the data columns were directly lost, so the sense of existence on the court was very low, It directly led to Celtic falling behind in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Tatum continued to be in the doldrums, and his action on the offensive end was extremely slow. What's more, he didn't have a strong desire to score. In the second quarter, he made only five shots and hit once, which was a devastating blow to Celtic's offensive end. Their first points were extremely difficult, and they were pulled back to 24 points by the nets in half a game.
