March 21 News, since joining the Brooklyn basketball nets, Blake Griffin has been truce so far. According to the ESPN reporter Malika Andrews, Griffin's current status has been upgraded to the possibility of playing, which means that Griffin is expected to usher in the first show on behalf of his new club in the match with the Washington Wizards on March 21 local time.

"Blake Griffin is likely to make his debut as a nets player against the Wizards on Sunday local time. According to the team injury report, Griffin's condition has been raised to the possibility of playing Reporter Malika Andrews said.

In the past few seasons, Griffin's performance in the pistons has obviously declined a lot. It's sad to see that the most exciting player in NBA history has been reduced to the point of becoming a three-point shooter and still unable to put the ball in. It is reported that the nets will let Griffin play the fifth position, which is a very interesting strategy. In this season's 20 games for the pistons, Griffin averaged 12.3 points, 5.2 rebounds, 36.5% shooting and 31.5% three-point shooting.
