On March 21, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continues. Today, LeBron James, the core of the Lakers, suffered a sprained right ankle in the game against the hawks and left early.

After the match, Zhan Huang was diagnosed with a high sprain of his right ankle and will be suspended indefinitely. Some reporters predict that James may have to rest for 6 to 8 weeks to fully recover.

But in the days of Zhan Huang's truce, Nongmei couldn't play. How should the Lakers deal with it?

In the Laker team, a mainstream voice believes that internal potential tapping is the first choice. Schroeder, Kuzma, Maurice, Harrell and others also made it clear in an interview that after James was injured, the team should have the determination to "stand up next".

The reporter who reports the game with the team all the year round thinks that the young guard Horton Tucker on the bench may become the main target of tapping potential, and his role in the team may surge in the future.

However, at the same time, some experts believe that seeking help from outside, especially before the trade deadline, may be the best way to solve the urgent situation of the Lakers.

Unfortunately, at present, the number of chips available to the Lakers is very limited. In the off-season, they signed Monterey Harrell with full middle class. In this case, no matter how the Lakers operate, they can not trigger the hard salary cap. Next, the team's total salary can only be increased by $1.7 million on the existing basis (at most).

That is to say, without touching the core framework, it is very difficult for the Lakers to get a real player with strength. And in the case of dual core injury, it is the critical period for role players to work hard. At this time, a large area of exchange and trading can only be a greater blow to the morale of the Lakers.

In addition, the right of draft that can be traded in the hands of the Lakers is also very limited. At present, the earliest time they can sign in the first round is 2027, and the earliest time they can sign in the second round is 2023. Players that can be traded in the team, such as Matthews (3.6 million US dollars per year) and McKinney (1.8 million US dollars per year), but their market value is very low.

Therefore, compared with the big deal, the only thing the Lakers can do is to make minor repairs. On the one hand, they can go to the market to find a suitable firefighter, such as koshins, the old Laker who has some fighting power at least in the offensive end.
