March 21 News, ESPN famous reporter Adrian wojnarowski latest report, a number of sources revealed that the Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James suffered a high sprain in his right ankle, will be an indefinite truce.

According to previous reports, James' Ankle X-ray results were negative and there was no structural damage, but the team is still waiting for James' MRI results to determine the severity of the injury.

In the second quarter of the game with the Hawks, James and Solomon Hill were hit by the latter in the fight and pressed to the right ankle. James immediately fell to the ground in pain and grasped his right ankle. After the Lakers called a halt, several teammates, coaches and team doctors came to inquire about the situation. James himself got up, limped back to the bench, took a short rest and went back to the game. But then James returned to the dressing room again for treatment and announced his absence for the rest of the game. Sources said the frustrated James knocked over a nearby chair on his way back to the dressing room.

On James' injury, Kyle Kuzma said: "I didn't see what happened at that time, but this may be the first time I've seen him scream and angry so much."

The Laker player Harrell also talked about Hill's foul after the game, "I think this is a completely unnecessary action, because hill has to cross James's leg before he can touch the ball. Although I don't think hill did it on purpose, it's obviously an action that needs to be "reviewed again.". I think the referee on duty should review the foul and hill should get more punishment than an ordinary foul. We often forget that he is also an ordinary person. " Harrell said.

Dennis Schroeder, a Laker, also thought it was an unnecessary move. "I think it's unnecessary for hill to jump on James' leg." Schroeder said.

It is worth mentioning that hill also updated his personal social media to talk about the foul: "he will not disrespect the game and deliberately let other players leave the field, and he knows that. It's the most important thing for me. Pray for an early recovery. "

In addition, the alliance stars have also sent a message to pray for James.

Makif Morris: "we are all praying for the best."

Trey young: "I pray James is all right. I hope he is all right."

Jamal Crawford: "pray for LeBron!"
