On March 21, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continues. Today, LeBron James, the core of the Lakers, suffered a sprained right ankle in the game against the hawks and left early.

After the match, Zhan Huang was diagnosed with a high sprain of his right ankle and will be suspended indefinitely. Although Zhan Huang himself quickly said that he would return as soon as possible, some experts and reporters are not optimistic about this.

"Although James is not an ordinary person, it usually takes 6-8 weeks for him to recover," alash makaz, a famous basketball player in Los Angeles, who has been reported to the team for many years, said on twitter

According to the schedule, if James has to wait 8 weeks to return, then the regular season will be over, that is to say, James has basically given up the regular season.

You know, in the past period of time, the injury of the thick eyebrow brother has brought great trouble to the Lakers. Now, the injury of James makes the team worse.

Makaz joked that after James' injury, young player Horton Tucker might be used as a superstar.

In addition, famous player Adrian wernalovski pointed out that with James and thick eyebrow injured at the same time, the playoff pattern of the whole western region is likely to change a lot. At present, the Lakers are third in the west, but they are only six games ahead of the warriors, who are ninth in the West. With two months left in the regular season, this is not an impossible gap to catch up with.

After losing to the Hawks, the record of the Lakers came to 28-14. What's worse, the morale of the team suddenly became very low. A number shows that the difficulty of the remaining schedule of the Lakers ranks sixth in the league. That is to say, in the future, most of the opponents of the purple gold army are very strong, and maybe they will encounter bitter battles frequently.

One view is that the decline of the Laker's ranking is inevitable, and by the end of the regular season, whether they can keep the top eight has become unknown.
