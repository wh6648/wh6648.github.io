On April 24, 2021, the green army lost 104-109 to the nets. Tatum scored 38 points and 10 rebounds in 14 of 27 shots, hitting six three points, while smart scored 19 points.

The East is now concerned about the nets, Philadelphia, bucks and even the Hawks are climbing, and the heat and the green army are actually the most dangerous hunters in the eastern playoffs. It is basically impossible to pass these two teams in the East, so for the nets, the green army may always be an opponent they have to face.

After the opening, Tatum completed his three-point projection in the previous two games, and fired successfully in the outside line, including the one-on-one three-point shooting against Harris in the bottom corner. Seven minutes in the first quarter, Tatum even dislocated in the bottom corner to face his old teammate Owen and made another shot. As for the green army, the recent recovery of their interior is also one of the reasons for the recovery of their record. TT's recent recovery, with 6 points and 6 rebounds in the first quarter, has basically tied their average level this season (8 points and 8 rebounds).

At the beginning of the second quarter, the nets hit a 12-3 climax. At this time, Tatum's three-point shot through the heart helped the team stop bleeding. In fact, in the past two games, Tatum's three-point shot was only 2-for-12. In this game, he returned to the outside touch ahead of time, and his three-point shot also exceeded his average of this season (2.8). In the fourth minute of the second quarter, the net, which had been crazy in the outside line, pulled the point difference to 10 points, or Tatum was misplaced to face Griffin's defense and stopped bleeding again in a three-point shot with a backward step.

In the last three minutes of the half-time, the green army was pulled to a gap of more than 10 points by the opponent for the third time, or Tatum hit three points. In the whole half, the green army had to rely on Tatum's three points to recover the difference many times, otherwise the green army might spend the half-time. In the half-time game, Tatum scored 25 points, the whole team only scored 51 points, hit five three points, and the whole team scored eight three points, which helped the green army to attack. In the third quarter, after Tatum's silence, smart's four three-point goals really saved the green army. Apart from his contribution on the offensive end, smart made outstanding contribution on the defensive end, because he was the first choice to defend Owen in the whole game.

In the last three minutes of the fourth quarter, the green army, who was 17 points behind for a time, with Tatum's three points and Smart's defense, caught up with the difference to three points. Everyone thought that at the end of the game, the green army revived and played their best tough performance. In the last two minutes of the game, Tatum finished the 2 + 1 layup, which was his fourth time to save the team and gave the green army the last hope. However, in the last 1:32 seconds of the game, smart, who had been brilliant at both the offensive and defensive ends, actually passed the ball to his teammates outside the court, which was a mistake that ruined the green army's perfect chance of chasing points. In the end, the green army regretted missing the chance to catch up with the points. Tatum even missed two free throws in the last six seconds and lost the game. Tatum played a nearly perfect performance, but was unable to return.
