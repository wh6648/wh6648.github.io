On April 24, 2021, the Nets beat the green army 109-104. Owen scored 15 points, 9 rebounds, 11 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks against the old owner.

Recently, the nets have been hit by injuries again, and Owen's recent performance is still eye-catching. Against the green army, Owen has scored 77 points with a shooting rate of more than 60% in the past two games, which is really a sense of love and killing. The first time Owen touched the ball after the start, he and little Jordan finished a pass to the ground to help the basket take the lead. Many people in the net were unable to play in this game, which was Owen's one-man leading mode.

After that, the green army made a 9-2 attack, but then Owen began his performance. He first hit the basket on the left, facing the fierce confrontation of o'jielai, Owen's body was like a twist, but he still twisted to finish the 2 + 1 shooting. Then Owen even grabbed smart on the defensive side. In recent games, Owen's defense has even become the top presence of the whole team. Both sides of the attack and defense are carrying the team.

In the second half of the first quarter, Owen even staged on-the-spot counter attack again. At this time, Owen has completed three steals. In the first quarter, although Owen only scored 7 points, he had 2 rebounds, 2 assists and 3 steals. After returning to the court in the second quarter, Owen let the green army down on the defensive end, missed the close layup, and sent out two assists in a short minute, including another cake eating slam dunk for little Jordan. At this time, the rebound climax has led by 12 points.

After entering the second half, Owen's attack began to show his strength. In a breakthrough, he even knocked smart down and made a layup all the way into the unguarded restricted area. On the defensive side, we have to say that Owen's progress, a star guard who was criticized as a defensive black hole, has been improving his defensive ability in recent years, including his defensive awareness and judgment. In the third quarter, he made a cunning early foul on his old teammate TT, which even made TT feel extremely angry.

In the fourth minute of the third quarter, Owen once again tore up smart's defense. He made a direct pass to assist brown to complete the startling dunk. Owen's ability of sudden points is different from harden's rhythm. He relies on his extremely skilled dribbling and offensive talent. In the last two minutes of the third quarter, Owen once again attacked and defended at both ends, with free throws, steals and coordination, and twice targeted assists. Harris hit three points. After directing a wave, he let the nets lead to 16 points.

In the last three minutes of the game, the situation suddenly changed, and the net was chased to three points by the green army. As a result, Owen first protected a rebound, and then sent a fatal assist after the counterattack. These five points helped the team stabilize the situation again. In the last minute of the game, Owen's crucial defense for Tatum helped the team to win, and the nets finally defeated the green army and returned to the first position in the East.
