On April 24, the nets officially announced that star Kevin Durant will be absent from today's home game against Celtic.

At present, the injury list of the nets has a total of seven players. In addition to KD, there are James Harden, who is suffering from hamstring injury, and Spencer dingweidi and Taylor Johnson, who are in the knee recovery period. Chris chiosa is trapped with an arm injury, while Alex Johnson and Nicholas Clarkston are under the health and safety agreement.

Today is Durant's third game of absence due to thigh contusion. Before that, KD was on the sidelines against pelicans and raptors. KD was injured in the first quarter of Monday's game against the heat, and the current news is that his injury is not very serious.

Before today's game, Nets coach Steve Nash was asked Durant, "his contusion is not completely good, and now there is still a little distance from his comeback," Nash said. "It's not sure whether he can play (local time) Sunday against the Suns, but he should come back in our next road trip."

It is worth mentioning that KD has suffered from injuries many times this season. He just came back on April 8 local time. He was absent for nearly two months because of the injury to his right hamstring.

James Harden also suffered from injury and was absent in a row. Data show that the three giants of the nets (Durant, harden and Carey Owen) have only played seven games together this season.

So far this season, Durant has played 24 regular season games for the basketball nets, averaging 32.7 minutes, 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.3 blocks.
