On April 24, the nets officially announced that they had signed a 10 day contract with Mike James. Having completed his physical examination and registration, James can represent the nets in today's game against Celtic.

Before the game, Nets coach Steve Nash said: "to be honest, I haven't met him yet, but he can play today."

James previously played in Russia's elite central army in Moscow, but was banned because of a dispute with the coach. In this context, James left Moscow to return to the United States, and intends to return to the NBA.

According to previous rumors, the nets and the Knicks have expressed interest in James. After weighing, James chose to go to Brooklyn.

James played 36 games for the suns and pelicans in the 17-18 season, averaging 19.1 minutes, 9.3 points, 2.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists.

Before being suspended by Moscow Central Army, James had a remarkable performance this season, averaging 31.0 minutes, 19.3 points, 3.1 rebounds and 5.7 assists.

James is qualified to represent the nets in the playoffs because he has not been on the list of any NBA team since April 9.
