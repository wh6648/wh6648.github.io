Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James recently criticized the NBA playoff playoff playoff system and suggested that the creator of the system should be fired. Evan wasch, executive vice president of NBA basketball strategy and analysis and founder of the new all star game model, the "creator" of the playoffs, told the Washington Post reporter Ben goliver that he understands James' criticism and suspicion of the league, but he does not win praise for the success of the new proposal. He also believes that the benefits of the playoffs outweigh the disadvantages.

After the Lakers lost to the Raptors at home, James talked about the playoff playoffs in an interview. "If we end up fifth or sixth, or go to play in the playoff playoffs, anyway... The problem is - no matter who comes up with this bad idea, we should be fired." James said.

In an interview with Ben goliver, Evan wasch said he fully understands James' criticism and suspicion of the league, but he also believes that the benefits of the play off outweigh the disadvantages.

"Obviously, we welcome feedback from our players and team," Evan wasch said, "but overall, we think the benefits of the playoffs outweigh the disadvantages."

Evan wasch said that the implementation of the playoffs is to give more fans a reason to stick to the end of the season and to create a more competitive atmosphere¡° In a wider range of rankings, for teams who want to improve, it will greatly stimulate the competitiveness of the team. The goal is to make more teams, more markets and more fans feel that there is something worth fighting for. On this basis, it is absolutely successful. " Evan wasch said.

In fact, LeBron James is not the only one dissatisfied with the play off. Dallas Lone Ranger star Luca dongqiqi also thinks the play off is meaningless¡° I don't understand the current mechanism of NBA playoffs. You have to play 72 games in the regular season. In the playoff, I may lose two games in a row and be out. I don't understand the meaning of that

Kenyon Martin also shared his views on the playoff today. There is no doubt that he agrees with James and Dong Qiqi¡° The biggest problem for me is this way of playing. I think this is the hypocrite of S * * t. I think my brain is broken. I think it's extremely stupid. As LeBron James said, people who make things up should be fired. If two eighth and ninth teams have the same record, let them play one, two or three mini series games, and then see who can win, I can understand. But there are four teams? It makes no sense at all. " Kenyon Martin said in a podcast.

Kenyon Martin even said that this is just a money making plan of the NBA¡° I'm sure (the League) is trying to make up for last year's losses. They're trying to make up for the bubbles and all those things that don't have fans watching Martin said.

According to the playoff rules, the NBA will play off the playoffs from May 19 to 22 after the regular season. The playoffs are played by the 7th to 10th teams in each division. The winner of the former group can directly lock in the seventh place in the regular season, while the loser of the latter group can directly eliminate. Next, the loser between 7th and 8th will play another game with the winner between 9th and 10th to decide the final playoff seat.
