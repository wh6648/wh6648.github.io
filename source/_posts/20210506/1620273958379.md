On May 6, according to reports from the US media, well-informed sources revealed that the Laker superstar LeBron James will try to play again in the regular season this season, but his right ankle injury may have to wait until the off-season to fully recover.

The Lakers lost to the Raptors on May 3. In the fourth quarter of that game, James returned to the dressing room with an injury. Then the Lakers officially announced that James was out of the game with a sore right ankle. Then James missed Tuesday's game with the Nuggets. According to previous rumors, James is expected to miss the back-to-back games against the clippers and blazers on May 7 and 8.

One NBA reporter said: "I think LeBron will try to play in the regular season again, maybe later next week. He has a great deal of tolerance for injuries, he has shown that in his career, and he is determined to play, but now the ankle really needs a rest

"LeBron's ankle may not be fully recovered until the off-season, and he will have to fight with an injury in the playoffs," the NBA reporter continued. "So when we approach the last game of the regular season next week, we will see that LeBron wants to promote his comeback, or try to leave some time to recover to 100% as much as possible. But I don't think LeBron will be 100% fit for the rest of the season

Sources said that if the playoffs start now, then James will play 100%.

So far this season, James has played 43 games for the Lakers, averaging 33.7 minutes, handing over 25.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.8 assists and 1.05 steals.
