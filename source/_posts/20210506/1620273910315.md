On May 6, the NBA announced today that Carey Owen and the Brooklyn nets were fined $35000 each for violating NBA media coverage rules.

"The fine was due to Owen's repeated refusal to participate in post match media interviews," the NBA said in a statement

NBA requires that before or after every game, as long as the media reporters ask, healthy players can be interviewed. Throughout the season, Owen refused to be interviewed by the media several times at the team's press conference. The most recent one happened after the nets lost 118-124 to Milwaukee Bucks, Owen refused to include ESPN's request for an interview.

In fact, this is the second time Owen and the nets have been fined for not complying with the League media rules this season. In December last year, Owen repeatedly refused to be interviewed by the media during training camp, after which he and the nets were fined $25000 each.

Owen responded to the fine on his personal social media instagram¡° I pray that we can use these "fines" where we need help, especially considering the world we live in. I've been fighting for peace, love and greatness, so don't sow dissension between me and my team any more. We respect art. Our direction is very different. I don't talk to pawns. My attention is more valuable. " Owen wrote.

So far this season, Owen has played 49 games for the nets, averaging 27 points, 4.9 rebounds and 6.3 assists. Owen is currently on a four-year contract worth $136 million with a salary of $33.32 million this season.
