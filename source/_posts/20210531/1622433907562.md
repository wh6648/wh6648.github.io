On May 31, in the just concluded fourth game between the Lakers and the Suns, the inner core of the Lakers, Nongmei, pulled his groin at the end of the first half in the process of a less intense layup, and then withdrew from the rest of the game. In the end, the Lakers lost to the Suns 92-100, and the total score was 2-2.

After the team won the third game with the double core of thick eyebrow and James, the voice of the Lakers on Dirk became more and more high, and even many fans thought that they would sweep the opponent 4-1. In the first two rounds of last season's playoffs, the Lakers lost to the Blazers and the Rockets in the first game respectively, but in the end they both reversed and defeated their opponents with a total score of 4-1, which makes us have reason to believe that James's team's losing the first game of the series is a routine operation, which will not affect their quick adjustment and crush their opponents.

The first three games of the series are still in accordance with the most familiar script of the Laker fans. The first game of the series is mainly to test the opponent. After a little resistance on the scene, the team will call a golden end. In the second game, thick eyebrow swept away the depressed state of the first game, changed the lazy style in the interior line, cut down 34 + 10 double and led the team to blow the counterattack horn. In the third game, Shau Mei and James joined hands to contribute 55 points. The Lakers won a double-digit victory. The Suns' general Booker collapsed in the last quarter and was expelled for malicious fouls. The balance of this round of series seems to be completely on the side of the Lakers.

However, this game, thick eyebrow again into the doldrums, half-time 9 shot only 2, what's worse, thick eyebrow's injury makes people sweat. Groin strain is a very delicate injury, which can be light or severe. James is often troubled by this kind of injury. With good luck, thick eyebrow can be slightly injured, but once the injury is not good, he may not appear in the future for a long time. The lack of a thick eyebrow, the strength of the Lakers will be in an obvious downwind, after all, their opponent is the second Western suns.

In the third quarter of today's game, it's not difficult to see that the threat of the offensive end of the Lakers will be greatly reduced when Bushu Mei goes off the court. Especially when James starts an attack with the ball, the Suns know that the opponent's ability to end the inside line is limited, so they put more energy on blocking James's personal breakthrough and force him to transfer the ball to his teammates outside the three-point line, As we all know, it is the most unreliable offensive choice for the Lakers to rely on outside projection to solve the problem. As a result, James made six mistakes and scored seven three points, which was inefficient.

Of course, the Lakers didn't see any positive factors in the second half. At least when little Gasol came on the court, his high-level coordination ability brought some positive changes to the attack of the Lakers. He played some brilliant cooperation with James and Schroeder, and he also hit three points. If the game after the thick eyebrow are unable to play, Vogel might as well use more small Gasol to improve the efficiency of attack.
