In the third quarter, Owen passed the ball to Griffin. Then Owen quickly interposed it. When his teammates missed the shot, Owen, who was defenceless, suddenly shot out and successfully made up the ball with both hands.

This season's playoffs, Owen's single highest score is 29 points. In the third quarter of the game, Owen made a strong three-point shot one step away from the three-point goal.
