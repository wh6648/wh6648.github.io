On May 31, the Nets beat Celtic 141-126 away, leading 3-1 in the series. It is worth mentioning that the uncivilized incident of fans making trouble appeared again after the game. Basketball nets superstar Carey Owen on his way back to the dressing room, a fan threw a water bottle at him. According to Malika Andrews, the fan has been taken away by security and Boston police.

"We have always stressed that we are human, we are human. But now a lot of old things have been turned out. It's potentially racist, and you're treated like you're in a zoo Owen said after the game about someone throwing a water bottle at him.

Kevin Durant also talked about this after the game. "Fans should grow up. I know that a year and a half of COVID-19 has made many people nervous. But when you come to the arena, you must realize that we are all normal people. We are not animal, nor are we in circus. You're not only a fan, you have to respect the sport, respect humanity, respect yourself. Your mother won't be proud of you throwing water bottles at players, spitting at players or throwing popcorn. It's more important than what you do to enjoy the game Durant said.

"I understand Boston fans' dissatisfaction with Carey Owen and hope we don't have to come back here in this series Durant said.

James Harden said throwing a water bottle at Carey Owen was "unacceptable", and it was not enough to ban the fan from entering the stadium to watch the game, because this kind of behavior continues, "someone has to make an example.".

"It's crazy, it shouldn't be a part of the game, it shouldn't happen in any stadium," said Bruce Brown, referring to Owen being thrown a water bottle by Celtic fans after the game

In addition, Marcus smart said that the fan who threw a water bottle at Carey Owen was taken away by the stadium security personnel. He also said that one fan can not represent the whole fan group.
