Last season, Milwaukee Bucks were swept 4-1 by the Miami Heat in the playoffs. The Soha team sent off bradso and hill and brought in Holliday and tucker. The Bucks paid the price of running in, ranking third in the East in the regular season, and once again encountered the heat in the playoffs. This time, the team didn't disappoint the fans and beat the heat 4-0. There are deep-seated factors behind this.

Bucks can sweep the heat, there are objective factors for the decline of heat strength. In order to attract big fish in the 2021 off-season, the heat do not hesitate to let go of Claude and Jones in the 2020 off-season. However, the introduction of Ariza and beliza is not enough to make up for the loss, and the defensive strength of the front line declines; Team injury and the impact of the new coronavirus, lack of running in, once lack of members to let Vincent This edge players lead the team; The introduction of the team's oladipo because of right knee surgery season reimbursement, beliza embarrassed. The old players have fallen down, and Hiro is embarrassed to be reused after he was promoted to the first team. His performance is not as good as last season, and the three-point shooting rate in the playoffs has dropped to 31.6% (37.5% last season); Dengluo has a slight decline; Jimi Butler and Adebayor regular season also get together, the playoffs are declining, Butler only 14.5 points, Adebayor 15.5 points, which has "double hot" style? On the contrary, Dragic, who won the first round because of injury, regained his hand because of enough rest in the playoffs and became the heat's highest scoring player (averaging only 16 points per game).

The heat's collective decline is closely related to the short off-season. The off-season period is only two months. Last season's top four teams, the Lakers, the heat, the Nuggets and Celtic, all suffered injury crisis, with three teams falling to the second half. The abnormal devil training system of the heat undoubtedly exacerbated this crisis, even if the iron man such as Jimi Butler can not bear it. Owen's ally Bradley left the Lakers to join the heat, moved by the heat's training camp, he said: "the heat's training intensity is too big, far more than the Lakers. You feel the intensity and energy of the training in a moment... And they say there has been no reduction. What impresses me most is the intensity of their training every day. " Unfortunately, the reality is too tough, he only played 10 games in the heat, was traded to the Rockets now retired edge.

The heat's playing style this season is close to that of last season. Their attack is still focused on positional warfare, playing a slow cutting system, averaging 97.1 rounds per game (second from the bottom of the League), but sending 26.3 assists per game (ninth in the League). However, the lack of super scorers restricts the future of the team. The defensive end uses a large number of regional defense, supplemented by man to man and mixed defense. It has strong antagonism and steady strength, which is suitable for the elimination system in the playoffs. However, Claude and Jones left to thin the team's attack line, which has a great impact on both ends of the attack and defense. The new belicha's defensive end can be called a point sending boy, although he has delicate skills and dare not reuse them. Ariza's playing time is short in recent years, and the offensive side has declined seriously. Two of the four playoffs have zero points, so he can't compare with Claude. On the defensive side, Claude is heavier than Ariza, more solid in defense and stronger in confrontation. Although he does not have Ariza's defensive wisdom, he is more suitable for defending. Last season, the heat set up a trans regional joint defense against the letter brother. The strong defensive double forwards (Butler, Claude, Iguodala or little Jones) stand on the wing, the two defenders (Dragic, dunro and Hiro) stand at the bottom corner to protect, and the center Adebayor stands in the restricted area (which is different from the traditional layout of the guard standing on the wing and the forward standing at the bottom corner). When the letter brother from the side of the breakthrough, the team three closed, grabbed the letter brother, Claude played the role of rock against the letter brother. Now instead of Claude Ariza can not do this, was easy to break through the letter brother, the regional joint defense appeared leakage ring.

Turn to the bucks. The bucks are still the second fastest team in the league with 102.9 rounds per game. However, the proportion of positional warfare is increased, the proportion of "magic ball" is no longer played, and the proportion of midshots is increased. The average number of midshots per game is 14.5 (the seventh in the League), and the hit rate is as high as 51.7% (the fourth in the League); The letter brother improved the low position singles ability, learning to pass the ball ability, especially the ability to break the regional joint defense; After the introduction of Tucker, the defensive end is no longer limited to the crouching defense dominated by Berger and Lopez, increasing the proportion of unlimited defense changes. All in all, sharpen your knife to the heat. The Bucks' shortcomings still exist: the technology of letter brother is still rough, and the projection is almost abandoned; Middleton's attack is unstable. Whether they can stand the test at the critical moment is still a question mark. The team lacks a good playmaker, and coach budenhower's poor on-the-spot command is still in question. Bucks and heat encounter, Bucks win the key is to speed up the output of three points, the collapse of the heat's regional defense; The heat, on the other hand, lowered the tempo to break down the Bucks' offensive system with regional joint defense. Three points is the key to win or lose, the heat area joint defense loopholes in the three-point line, the Bucks hope to create three-point opportunities through the ball conduction; Although the Bucks increased the proportion of unlimited defense, still use a lot of squatting defense, is still the league's worst three-point defense team.

As expected, the Bucks' average rounds dropped from 102.9 to 100.3, slowing down the pace of the series. In G1, the heat did use regional defense and Adebayor's top defense to insert the letter brother into the mire. The letter brother shot iron repeatedly, but the Bucks burst out with amazing adjustment ability.

When the letter brother was limited, Holliday and Middleton took over the task of the organization, and the letter brother changed to cover down or empty cut to eat cake; When the Bucks pick and roll, when the heat don't change defense, Huo and MI can shoot directly. When the heat change defense, letter brother can name the heat's defensive loopholes, such as Dragic, dunro, Hiro and Nan. Letter brother also increased low singles, Bucks win the first game, to help letter brother through G1 pain, adapt to the intensity of the confrontation. Since then, the letter brother has gone with the wind and water, playing the instant sense of "going to the fifth floor at one go". He has broken through Ariza and Jimi Butler, such as chopping melons and cutting vegetables, and his field of vision has also been improved. He can break through the joint defense on the free throw line, feed the ball to Lopez and huoledi on the inside line, or feed the ball to the three breakups on the outside line (G4 has sent 15 assists), and sometimes show Ariza in the low position singles, and find the sense of existence by turning over jump shot and hook.

Huoledi's reinforcing role is reflected, he can sink the bottom line or Z-shaped strong, or eat cake or low singles. He can also hold the ball at the top of the circle, pinch the sharp knife, and his strength helps Middleton get back the feeling of holding the ball. The Bucks have three good holding points this season, which they didn't have when bradso disappeared in the playoffs last season. Breakthrough points, low position singles, air cutting and free throw line coordination have become the elements of the heat's three axes joint defense. The team used the height advantage to ensure the front court board, and snatched the first front court board in the 15.3 League to ensure the attack, which is also the reason why the Bucks still won with a three-point shooting rate as low as 32.7% (players Forbes, Portis, Middleton and connorton all have a good sense of three-point break-up, but Ho, Lopez, divenzo and huoledi are seriously behind, 3%, 12. 5%, 16. 7% and 20% respectively.

Bucks in the defensive end of the adjustment is more effective, the letter brother full court mark Jimi Butler (he changed to Tucker defense when he left the court), with its height, arm spread, speed and projectile speed harass the heat stars, this is relative to last season's playoffs important adjustment (last season, buden was questioned that the letter brother is not allowed to defend Butler). According to the data matchups, Jimi Butler only scored 9 points and 10 assists, but made 4 mistakes. It can be said that Jimi Butler has snuffed out the heat's holding and organizational core, and then disintegrated the heat's attack. In addition, Middleton leads the defense of Duncan Robinson and Hiro, and Holliday leads the defense of Dragic and Nan, so the defense task is clear. The Bucks introduced Tucker at the end of the season, increasing the proportion of unlimited defense, no longer stick to the previous season's pit defense. When the Bucks use unlimited defense, players have height, arm spread, movement speed and coverage area, which will have a wonderful effect on the heat's three-point line. The heat have a 33.6% 3-point shooting rate, which is really a tough problem for the bucks.

Budenhorse has made progress in his on-the-spot command. He guarantees that at least two of the three stars will be present. When the letter is limited, huoledi and Middleton will hold the ball instead.
