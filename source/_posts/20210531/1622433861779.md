On May 31, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely. The Brooklyn nets easily beat the Boston Celtics 141-126, expanding the total score to 3-1. Durant opened the "God of death mode". He scored 17 points in a single quarter twice, and scored 42 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists in the whole game, breaking many team records in a single game.

Durant's defeat at TD garden in the third game of the series was very depressing. At the beginning of the fourth game of the series, Durant started the "death mode".

After a mid-range shot, Durant made 6 of 10 shots in the first quarter, 5 free throws, and 17 points in a single quarter.

When the game was 3:20, Owen played solo with the ball, but when he saw Durant plug in, he passed the ball at the first time, Durant went into the inside line and finished a wonderful smash.

With 17 points in a single quarter, Durant tied Kenyon Martin's scoring record in the first quarter of a single playoff game against the Lakers on June 13, 2002. The Nets' playoff scoring record is 19 points shared by Hollis Jefferson and Lowell.

Because team mate Owen's condition is very outstanding, moreover Durant second quarter also needs to preserve the physical fitness, therefore second quarter's Adu voluntarily surrenders the offensive ball right, he second quarter only has 2 points to enter the account.

It turns out that Durant's second quarter is for the third quarter to be a blockbuster again.

As in the first quarter, Durant scored 17 points in the second quarter. Whether it was a three-point dribble against the defense, or a sudden stop in the shooting, Durant's "death mode" made Celtic completely helpless.

Durant has scored more than 30 + in just three quarters, which is 25 + in four consecutive playoffs, ranking second in the history of the nets, after Carter in the first round of 2006. In addition, Durant, who scored 36 points in three quarters, scored at least 35 points in two consecutive playoffs, becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve this figure.

Durant, who had already killed his eyes, continued to play in the fourth quarter, but in order to limit his performance, Celtic did not hesitate to stop him with fierce fouls. A confrontation, Durant was hit in the head, the game was interrupted.

However, Durant will not be fierce foul disrupted his offensive rhythm, he will be more ferocious. In a short period of 27 seconds, Durant hit two three-point shots in a row. He not only broke through 40 points, but also expanded the basketball nets' leading edge to 27 points.

With four minutes left, Durant had a little friction with smart, the tough guy of the green army. They were talking rubbish all the way and kept on talking. Finally, the referee chose to blow and punish both sides for technical fouls, playing 50 boards each.
