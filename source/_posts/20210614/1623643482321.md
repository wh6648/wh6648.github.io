On June 14, the NBA playoffs continued. The Suns beat the Nuggets 125-118 to sweep them to the Western Conference finals.

In this game, Booker made 11 of 25 shots, scored 34 points, 11 rebounds and led the team to advance with 4 assists.

As soon as the game came up, Booker used a three-point backward step to open the first record, showing his determination to end the series. Then he used the bottom line tactics to catch the ball and shoot, resulting in the opponent's foul and two free throws. Booker's evolution is that he is more cautious about the choice of shots. He doesn't need to take all the shots as before, but every shot can cause a huge challenge to the opponent's defense.

Although Booker's attacking choice is very reasonable, Booker's feeling in the first quarter is not particularly good. In the second half of the first quarter, when Paul came off the court for a rest, Booker's attacking efficiency declined and he failed to hit the iron in a row. Fortunately, the Suns have established a strong confidence in the past Games, and the role players have played very well, so the Suns can continue to maintain the advantage.

In the second quarter, Booker's shot times are still not many, but the efficiency is very high. When the Nuggets are gaining momentum, Booker first uses the block to break through the seam to hit the elegant middle distance, and then when the opponent pursues the difference to two points, he uses the cover to catch the ball and hit the elegant three points to stabilize the situation. At the end of the first half, Booker first made a killing under the basket, then hit the middle distance in a row and helped the Suns lead the difference to 8 points again.

When Yi Bian fought again, Booker came up and rocked little porter to make a mid-range hit, then took the back court rebounds, counterattacked straight and killed one to three under the basket to attract the defensive assists. Although Booker made a key mistake in the middle of the third quarter, and the opponent took the opportunity to counterattack the three-point shot to catch up with the difference to one point, he immediately successfully completed the steals, made a one-stop counterattack and smashed it, instantly incarnated as an away muffler, and regained the initiative in the game. At the end of the third quarter, Jokic hit Penn in the face in a defense. As the core of the team, Booker stepped forward to stand out for his teammates. With Jokic being expelled, the momentum of the game is completely in the hands of the suns.
