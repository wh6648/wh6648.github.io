On June 14, the NBA playoffs continued. In the fourth game between Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns, Nuggets center joachi was directly expelled from the game because of a vicious foul, which was called a second level malicious foul. Moreover, he also had a conflict with Booker. This game, about the teacher contributed 22 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, but in this way to leave, more or less some lose and lose.

In the Western semi-finals, the Nuggets were 0-3 behind. Joachi averaged 35.3 minutes, 26 points, 14 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 46.4% shooting and 28.6% three-point shooting. From the data of the first round, "about teacher" average contribution 33 points, 10.5 rebounds, 4.5 assists, it is obvious that the data of about KIC showed a downward trend.

As the most valuable player of this season, joachi is absolutely better than the Suns champion Aton in terms of ability and strength. However, in the cumulative 48 minutes of being defended by sun center Aton, Jokic made 31 of 80 shots, with a shooting rate of 38.8%; 5 out of 16 3 points, with a hit rate of 31.3%; Only three free throws and seven turnovers.

Is Aton the "dead end" of Jokic?

In the fourth game of the series, Jokic played 20 minutes in the first two quarters. He made 7 of 13 shots and hit 53.8%, which is also his highest hit rate since PK with the suns. Two doubles with 18 points and 0 rebounds at half-time and four assists.

However, "about the teacher" three-point hit rate continued to decline, which seems to be one of the "champion" Aton's defensive strategy for Jokic - long shot, but not inside kill.

Joachi's three-point shooting percentage against the suns in the semi-final was 40%, 33% and 16.7%. According to the data, he went downhill, with 14 shots and 10 irons. It was not until the second quarter that we hit the first three points, but we started with a three-way tie.

As the Nuggets failed to exceed the score, and the Suns have always maintained more than 5 points, which led to the mood out of control. In the third quarter of the game, when it was 3:52, Jokic obviously lost control of the ball. Teacher Yue swung his right arm and hit Penn hard. As Penn fell to the ground, it also caused conflicts between Jokic and Booker.

Jokic and Booker confront each other, and they also have physical strength confrontation. Fortunately, the referee and the players of the two teams quickly came up to control the situation and did not let the conflict further escalate. Because of this vicious foul, Jokic was called a second level malicious foul, which means that "teacher Yue" was directly expelled.

However, when he left, Jokic politely walked up to Penn and apologized to him, but he didn't pay attention to Booker. With 22 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists, Jokic still feels like a loser.
