On June 14, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. The Phoenix Suns are away in Game 4 of the Western Conference semi-final with Denver Nuggets.

The Suns beat the Nuggets 125-118, swept them 4-0 in the series and took the lead in the Western Conference finals, their first Western Conference tour in the past 10 years.

This season, for the Nuggets, there is a huge harvest, although they failed to reach the Western Conference finals for the second year in a row, but several major players in the team have made breakthroughs in their career.

The first is core Nikolay Jokic. In this season's regular season, Mr. Jokic gave up his previous intermittent stroke strategy. He played 72 games with an average output of 26.4 points, 8.3 assists and 10.8 rebounds, and was elected MVP in the regular season at the end of the season.

As a result, Jokic became the first player in Serbia to win the MVP, and also the first regular season MVP in Nuggets' history.

In addition, Jokic became the third MVP from Europe in NBA history and the sixth MVP who kept full attendance in the season. Finally, Jokic is the first center player to win MVP in NBA in recent 21 years.

All these honors prove that Mr. Yue is different.

In addition, in the regular season, young porter grew rapidly, averaging 19 points per game, 10 points more than the previous season.

The addition of Aron Gordon, little rivers and campazo also brought changes to the Nuggets. As the top buckler in the league, Gordon joined nuggets and became an indispensable figure in both attack and defense. And kampazo's organization series, Xiao Li's three-point cold arrow, also in a certain maturity, shared about teacher's attack pressure.

Unfortunately, the second leader, Jamal Murray, has become the biggest variable in the Nuggets season. If Murray were there, the Nuggets might not be in such a mess in the series with the suns. After entering the semi-finals, little Porter has been troubled by low back injury, which also lowers the Nuggets' offensive output.

Of course, what's worse is that the dumb fire on the offensive end is not the only problem for nuggets. In the semi-final four games, they were completely found defensive weakness by the suns. When Mr. Yue was present, he either crouched under the basket or tried his best to expand to the three-point line, but left a huge vacuum in the middle distance position. But Paul and Booker are the best middle distance players in the league. As a result, when the two found a sweet spot, when they frequently stabbed the Denver defense line with their dagger sharp Zhongtou, the Denver's fighting spirit naturally dissipated.

At present, the team of nuggets has been basically fixed. Although the season ends ahead of schedule, it can be predicted that they will not make too many big moves in the off-season. In the next few years, the team will still build the lineup with Jokic as the absolute core. Therefore, this summer, to keep all the players healthy, especially to help Murray recover, has become the top priority of the team.

However, in the past series, the problem of Nuggets' slow attack and defense has gradually been magnified. Facts have also proved that at the crucial moment of the game, there are still not many reliable helpers around Jokic. Most of the time, it's too hard for Mr. Yue to fight. That's why Mr. Yue will end the season awkwardly on the night of G4 elimination by the way of expelling criminals.
