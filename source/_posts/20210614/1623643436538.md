On June 14, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. The Phoenix Suns are away in Game 4 of the Western Conference semi-final with Denver Nuggets.

The Suns beat the Nuggets 125-118, swept them 4-0 in the series and took the lead in the Western Conference finals, their first Western Conference tour in the past 10 years.

In fact, this season, the Suns have been making a fortune. From the slow start at the beginning of the season to the gradual rise of the ranking, the sun did not enter the scope of hot media discussion most of the time.

However, at the end of the season, the Suns were second in the west, with a 70.8% win rate, the highest since 2006-07.

In the first round of the playoffs, they didn't show any mercy in the face of the remnant team, and eliminated the defending champion in six fierce games. And now the second round, the sun once again high-profile promotion, and four ball down, they will attack and defense at both ends of the combat to a new height.

It is no accident that the Suns swept the Nuggets 4-0. In fact, since the first round of Tianwang mountain, they have won six consecutive games in the playoffs and set a new team record. In addition, they have won more than two figures in five of these six games.

After two rounds of series, it's hard to attribute all your achievements to one person. In the supporting roles, Mikael bridges, Claude and Penn on the wing take turns to make contributions. Especially at the beginning of the first round, Paul was injured and Booker was still in a relatively slow and hot state. The explosion of Penn injected new vitality into the sun.

And during the semi-final, the inside of Aton and come forward, he in the match with joachi, greatly consumed the new MVP, became the key factor of the team breakthrough.

Booker is also getting better and better. After a shocking 47 point individual performance in the first round of G6, he entered the semi-finals. In G4, his all-round output of 34 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists made Nuggets have no place to defend.

Of course, solar became the first team to enter the division finals this season, and Chris Paul's performance was the most critical point of all the elements.

You know, in the first round of the series, when Paul suffered a shoulder injury and once had to rely on his left hand to dribble, the outside world was very pessimistic about the future of the suns. However, after entering the second round, Paul adjusted, but slowly came out of the shadow of shoulder injury.

In G3, Paul had 17 points, 15 assists and 0 mistakes;

In G4, Paul got 27 points and 8 assists;

In the G5, Paul is determined to kill the series. His winning shot is like an apocalypse, scoring 37 points and 7 assists alone. This kind of output reminds us of the night when the Rockets first touched the floor of the Western Conference three years ago.

Obviously, Paul's shoulder no longer hurts. After two rounds of playoffs, he not only adjusted his state to a career peak, but also reached a new height in his chemical reaction with his teammates.
