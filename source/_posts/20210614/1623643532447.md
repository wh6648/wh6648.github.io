June 14 news, reports from the U.S. media said that today's eastern semi-final G4, the nets lost to the Bucks, the total score of the two teams tied 2-2.

In the second quarter of the competition, Carey Owen accidentally stepped on Janice adtokumbo's foot when landing, resulting in a sprained right ankle. Owen retired from injury, which had a huge impact on the overall strength of the basketball nets.

After the game, Nets coach Steve Nash revealed that Owen's right ankle had been X-rayed and the result was negative (no structural damage), so he will undergo further examination. Meanwhile, Nash revealed that he is not sure if Owen will play in the G5.

"We lost a great player, which made the game very difficult," Nash said, "but it's the playoffs and it's never easy."

On the other hand, Nash stressed that Owen's injury has nothing to do with James Harden's comeback plan.

"I think it's two separate events and I don't want harden to be forced to come back in a hurry," Nash said. "If he can play in the next game, that's good. But if he can't come back for the time being, I won't rush him back and risk a worse situation

"A quick comeback may turn harden's injury into a long-term one," Nash continued, "so we will re evaluate it, we will consider all factors and try to make a wise decision."
