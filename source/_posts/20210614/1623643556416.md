On June 14, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued, with the Milwaukee Bucks playing the Brooklyn nets at home. In this game, the Bucks blossomed more, just like the nets in the first two games, while the nets fell into the situation of Durant leading the team because of Owen's injury, just like the bucks in the first two games. Finally, the Bucks beat the nets 107-96, rewriting the series total score to 2-2.

After the start of the game, the nets changed the slow situation of the previous game. Under the leadership of Durant, the nets cut points continuously and stopped the Bucks directly. After the start of the strong attack also forced the letter brother to take the lead, continuous strong attack to help the Bucks stop bleeding. Then, the letter brother's strong play activated the Bucks, not only Middleton, hollerdy and others also stand out to help the letter brother, also let the Bucks have been biting the score.

In the second quarter, the situation suddenly changed, although Owen led the nets to take the lead in the attack, but the Bucks then played a wave of small climax. In the reversal of the situation, and the basketball nets to catch up, Owen accidentally injured in a strong attack, and then directly back. This also makes the original big three nets team only Durant one person.

Since then, the development of the plot is very dramatic. The nets are just like the bucks in the first two games. Durant is the only one left to lead the team. Although his teammates occasionally score, they are difficult to attack continuously. Once Durant leaves the court, the Nets' attack will fall into a complete downturn. On the Bucks side, under the leadership of brother alphabet, all the Bucks were completely activated, and four of them scored double except brother alphabet. Among them, Middleton and hollerdy repeatedly scored at critical moments to help the Bucks keep leading.
