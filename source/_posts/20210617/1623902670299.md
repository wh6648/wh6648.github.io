On June 17, Phoenix Suns announced today that Chris Paul could not play due to the health and safety agreement. The team will update Paul's latest status on Sunday. It is worth mentioning that Paul has been absent from training for two consecutive days.

According to League regulations, players who have been vaccinated with the new crown vaccine will shorten their isolation time when triggering the league's health and safety agreement. Chris Paul has been vaccinated against the new crown, which means he can return faster than players who were tested positive before the vaccine was ready earlier this season, an anonymous source said.

"My faith will not be shaken, because we have encountered some obstacles." Suns coach Monty Williams said in an interview today, "we have had difficulties all season and overcome a lot of them. You look forward to these challenges, you embrace them and move on. "

The Suns trained without Paul and began to prepare for the Western Conference finals, but now there is more uncertainty than originally thought. The Suns don't know who their opponents are and when they will start. Now they are not sure when their star will be ready. Head coach Monty Williams revealed that the team is dealing with the emotional ups and downs caused by various uncertain factors, from the climax of sweeping Nuggets into the Western Conference finals in the second round to Paul's uncertain state, which is predictable.

"One of the things we said was, if you're crazy enough to listen to me here, we'll do the right thing. That's to focus on the next training, the next video session. I just left the stadium, and that emotion is not real. Our players know we've had some problems this year, and so have other teams. It's just part of the NBA Williams continued. However, Williams did not disclose any details of Paul's health.

In March, the League relaxed its previous health and safety agreement in response to players and coaches choosing to be vaccinated. But NBA alliance also issued a statement at the time: "if the symptoms of COVID-19 are consistent with individuals, it is necessary to implement the previous agreement", which means that anyone with these symptoms may "be isolated", whether they are vaccinated or not.

It is worth mentioning that the NBA Alliance announced today that since June 10th, 164 players have been tested by COVID-19, one of whom has been diagnosed as positive, and the result of three consecutive weeks of League wide testing is zero.

In addition, coach Williams said that he had some exchanges with Paul, the chat content was very extensive, including their frustration, team guard Devon Booker was not selected into the NBA best team, "this is really a joke." Williams said. More disappointed, the Suns didn't have a player in the defensive team of the year.

The Suns beat Denver Nuggets 4-0 in the Western Conference semi-final, where they will play the winners between Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Clippers, who are now tied 2-2 in the Western Conference semi-final. If the jazz and the Clippers finish the series in Game 6, the Western Conference finals will start next Monday. If the jazz and the Clippers compete for seven, the Western Conference finals may start next Wednesday.

It is very important for the Suns whether Paul can release the isolation in time to participate in the Western Conference finals. He averaged 25.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 10.3 assists in the Western Conference semi-finals, leading the team to complete the first series sweep in his career.
