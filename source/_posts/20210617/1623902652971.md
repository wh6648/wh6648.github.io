June 17 news, from the "Arizona sports network" reported that informed sources revealed that the Suns star Chris Paul conducted a new crown test, the results were positive.

Sources said that Paul had been vaccinated with the new crown vaccine, but the test results were still positive.

Warriors defender Damian Lee has also been vaccinated after the diagnosis of a new crown case, when he was absent for a month.

What's happening now is that Paul has triggered the alliance health and safety agreement, and he will have an indefinite truce. It is not clear when Paul will qualify for the game, and whether CP3 will catch up with the first game of the Western Conference finals.

It is pointed out that Paul has received the positive test results of the new crown, and he has been vaccinated before, so this makes the situation very complicated.

NBA officials announced today that in 164 new crown tests last week, one player tested positive for the new crown. There are signs that the player is Paul.

For Paul, this year's postseason trip is very bumpy. At the beginning, he suffered a shoulder injury, and now the new crown test is positive again.

Paul, 36, has averaged 31.2 minutes in the playoffs this year, with 15.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 1.2 steals.
