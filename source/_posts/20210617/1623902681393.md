On June 16, according to famous NBA reporter shams charania, Phoenix Suns star Chris Paul triggered the health and safety agreement of the league and will have an indefinite truce.

It's not clear if Paul can make it to the opening game of the Western Conference finals. According to reporter shams charania, "according to the agreement, when vaccinated individuals trigger the alliance health and safety agreement, their isolation time will be shortened."

It is worth mentioning that it is unclear whether Paul had been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz will compete for the fifth game of the series tomorrow, and the Suns are waiting for the winners. The first game of the Western Conference finals will start at 3:30 a.m. on the 21st.

It is worth mentioning that during this season's playoff playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James triggered the health and safety agreement because of his participation in commercial activities. However, the League later explained: "James has broken the established agreement and, as we have done in other similar incidents in the league, has solved the problem with the team." James then took part in team training and games.

When the Suns got Paul through trading, people in the industry generally believed that the Suns, which is the team in the playoffs at most, could not compete for the championship. But they used their outstanding performance to "slap" those who are not optimistic about their prospects. In the regular season, he won the second seed position in the West with a winning rate of more than 70%. In the first round of the playoffs, they easily eliminated the defending champion Lakers. In the Western Conference semi-final, they swept the Nuggets 4-0 and took the lead in the Western Conference finals. There is no doubt that Paul is the hero of the Suns' turnaround. In the four games of the Western semi-finals, Paul averaged 25.5 points and 10.3 assists per game, with a shooting percentage of 62.7%, a three-point percentage of 75% and a free throw percentage of 100%.
