On June 17, it was reported that the NBA playoff Eastern semi-final game between the 76ers and the Hawks had just ended. The Hawks went back to fight madly at the end of the game when they were 22 points behind at half-time. Under the leadership of Rowe and Trey Yang, they achieved a big reversal, narrowly winning the 76ers 109-106, rewriting the total score of the series to 3-2.

In the first three quarters of the game, the 76ers firmly controlled the game by relying on enbid's absolute advantage in the opposition position and Kouri's accurate long-range shot. However, in the fourth quarter, the situation suddenly changed, and Rowe suddenly made a violent walk, hit the long-range jump shot continuously, and led the Hawks to start a counterattack with 13 points in half a quarter. Trey - Yang followed closely, took over the burden of attack, scoring organization two hands, successfully revitalized the Hawks attack. The 76ers suddenly cut off the power at the offensive end, making mistakes one after another, and were overtaken by the Hawks. At the moment of life and death, the two penalties of enbid were not interrupted, which gave the last hope. The 76ers swallowed an unacceptable defeat.

It is not difficult to see from this game that nbid can crush his opponent completely when facing Capella. In this game, he made 12 of 20 shots, 13 free throws, 11 free throws, scored 37 points, 13 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks. Capella, who is opposite him, has only 6 points but 5 fouls. Although enbid only missed two free throws, it was the most critical two free throws in the whole game. This group of counterpoint in the series originally played a role in laying the tone of the game, but ultimately failed to determine the outcome of the game.

In most of the game time, the 76ers who take the initiative are 2-3 behind. The reason is that the key ball ability is not enough. As the dominant side of hard power, the 76ers played disorganized at the offensive end and relied on enbid's strong attack to maintain the advantage most of the time. Small Curry's excellent performance outside the three-point line seems to make up for Simmons' short board of shooting ability. However, at the critical moment, enbid encountered great defensive strength in the interior line, small Curry's medium and long-range shooting percentage also fluctuated, rivers and his 76ers obviously lack enough adaptability.

In contrast to the Hawks, although they were able to achieve such a surprising reversal in the fourth quarter, they relied more on the sudden feel, but their clear tactical play also contributed a lot. At a critical juncture, we can see that the eagles will not panic, they clearly know what kind of tactics they should carry out in the offensive end, they have absolute trust in their two core guards Rowe and Trey young, and the forward generals Collins and Gallinari just need to wait for the back court double nucleus to attract the defensive attention of the other side, and then make a firm move to complete the end.

Every time the game goes against the wind, the 76ers always lose power at the offensive end, and Simmons and Harris are the two main holding points of the 76ers' outside line. Harris only got 4 points in 2 of 11 shots, and didn't get a free throw in the whole game. Simmons only shot four times, he said impolitely that he did not have any threat in the offensive end, as the team's second leader, but became a drag in the attack, I'm afraid even Philadelphia fans can't accept it. On the free throw line, Simmons' 4-for-14 performance is hard to see. Basketball is the sport of five people. Even if curry is more accurate, Simmons' disastrous performance can not be saved.
