May 10 news, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Cole recently talked about NBA star Allen Iverson in a program.

Steve Cole will never forget the Friday 19 years ago when he joined the NBA on TNT team as a commentator. That day, Allen Iverson, who played for the Philadelphia 76ers, talked about training. At a news conference a few minutes later, Iverson described in detail the pain he experienced in the 2001-02 season, when his best friend rashaan langeford was shot. Cole said it was a fascinating moment because of Iverson's frankness, which he admired most.

"For me, looking back, I love Iverson. I like his passion, I like his energy, I like his willpower more. I think he's a lot like Russell Westbrook in many ways, maybe not everyone likes such a player. Maybe you don't like some aspects of him, but you have to appreciate his athletic ability and his ten-year desire to play. That's why I like Iverson Cole said.

Cole has also mentioned Iverson before when talking about some of the greatest players. In 2018, Cole told ESPN reporter Chris Haynes that Iverson's signature passing "changed the way players play.".

"Today's players and game development are all based on holding the ball, shaking and dribbling. So Iverson doesn't have to talk to change the game. If you look at every player who has grown up, you will find that he has completely changed a whole generation just by playing in his own way Cole said.
