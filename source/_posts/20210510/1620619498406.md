Los Angeles Lakers superstar Anthony Davis helped the team win the championship last year and signed a five-year $190 million contract with the Lakers in December. According to the real deal, Davis has bought a gorgeous and amazing mansion in Los Angeles' top affluent area (bellelle) for $32 million, according to the source.

Davis sold his property in West Lake Village at a loss in early 2021 for $6.6 million. It is worth mentioning that he bought the mansion for $7.5 million in 2018. Davis has been looking for a new house in the market since he renewed his contract with the Lakers. Recently, the media reported that Davis bought a mansion in bellelle for about $32 million.

The mansion covers an area of about 1550 square meters and has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms. According to the report, the swimming pool inside the mansion is more than 36 meters long, and there is also an indispensable basketball court. It is worth mentioning that the records show that the former owner of the mansion was an entrepreneur who bought the mansion for 16 million in 2016.

In addition, according to the report, Davis did not pay the huge sum of money in one lump sum, but bought the mansion with a 30-year loan after paying part of the money.

So far this season, Davis has played 32 games, averaging 21.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3 assists.
