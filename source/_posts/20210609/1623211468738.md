On June 9, ESPN reporter Baxter Holmes published a long article. According to the source, the NBA, the players' Union and the broadcasting partners have collectively made a decision to return the league's schedule to normal as soon as possible - a complete 82 game regular season and finals will end in June and the new season will start in October, rather than in the next few years.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NBA alliance has to make a decision to shorten the race. Some team health officials say these will affect the health management of their players next season. According to ESPN's Kevin Pelton data, the number of absentees in each game this season due to injury, new crown or rotation is 5.1, which is the highest number since he began tracking the data in 2009-10. This does not include games missed by players in the health and safety agreement. In addition, according to the data, all star players missed 370 (19%) of 1944 games this season, which is the highest single season absence rate in NBA history. Throughout the season, the team's health officials and management are worried that the players will have soft tissue injuries such as tendon strain. These types of damage may be related to fatigue and stress.

A Western trainer said that it is very difficult to train the players properly during the whole season, on the one hand because of the new crown health and safety agreement, on the other hand because the players lack sleep, leading to more rest. Shooting and training were cancelled.

"If you can't train, your soft tissue will be injured," the trainer said. "It's a well-known fact."

"It's cruel on the whole." One NBA general manager added.

Just last week, a number of NBA stars and coaches openly discussed the price of this season. Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone said: "I think this year has been the toughest of my nba20 years. Whether it's mental, physical or emotional. "

However, according to the source, the League does not think that the schedule or short off-season will increase the injury or wear of players, nor does it think that it limits the rest and recovery time. In addition, the League expects to involve the general manager and other team members in various competition issues, including the schedule, in a more formal way in the near future, the source said. According to the sources, the NBA, the players' Union and the broadcasting partners have collectively made a decision to return the league's schedule to normal as soon as possible.

"From the perspective of lifestyle and mental health, there has been a lot of pressure in the past two years. We should not ignore this. But from the perspective of the game, considering the past two shrinking seasons and the total time players have left the field between the off-season and the off-season, we are not in a worse position than normal in terms of overall loss, rest and recovery time Evan wasch, executive vice president of NBA basketball strategy and analysis, said in an interview.
