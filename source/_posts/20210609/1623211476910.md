On June 5, the Blazers officially announced that they had reached an agreement with manager Terry stotz, and the two parted ways. According to previous reports, pioneer star Damian Lillard hopes Jason Kidd can become the team's new coach, but the latter is not willing to take over the Blazers. At present, clippers assistant Chauncey Billups, nets assistant d'antony, University of Michigan coach Jovan Howard and Jeff Van Gundy are all potential candidates for the new coach of blazers.

After being eliminated by the nets 4-1 in the first round, Celtic's management also changed dramatically. Denny Angie, President of basketball affairs, will step down, and Brad Stevens, coach of the team, will replace Angie and enter the management of the team.
