According to US media reports, Nuggets center Jokic was elected the most valuable player of the season, becoming the lowest MVP in NBA history. The 41st selected in 2014 has played all 72 regular season games this season, averaging 26.4 points, 10.8 assists and 8.3 assists.

When it comes to Jokic, everyone's impression has always been that he has a good sense of shooting in the middle and long distance, has an excellent high level coordination ability, and is far ahead of the players in the same position in passing and control technology. But at the same time, he is also accompanied by fat and lazy performances. However, in this season, when other major MVP competitors are more or less troubled by injuries, Jokic suddenly appears in front of everyone with a very positive look. After weight loss, he has become one of the most durable superstars in the league, and his hard work on the field is also a flash.

In this season's regular season, Jokic interpreted the word "comprehensive" to the extreme. His scores, rebounds and assists ranked in the top 10 of the league. In a single season, his double doubles ranked first in the league in 60 times, and his triple doubles ranked second only to Williams in 16 times. His shooting percentage was as high as 56.6%. And if you still follow the mindset that Jokic will only float on the outside line, then he will prove you wrong with concrete performance. This season, he ranks third in the league in scoring from the inside and fourth in scoring from his second attack. In other words, this season's Jokic will cover his influence in every corner of the court, with his own efforts to complete all the Nuggets need him to do.

In NBA, a professional field with no lack of athletic talent, Jokic seems to be an alternative existence. He can't run fast and jump high, but he can always choose the most correct way in attack. It's not difficult to find that his basketball IQ is almost always superior to everyone else. When he chooses his own attack, he seems to be able to easily send the ball into the basket without fierce confrontation. When he chooses to create opportunities for his teammates, he can know exactly where each teammate is and how they want to score without looking at them.

His basketball IQ can be attributed to his talent, but his real transformation this season is that he is more competitive, and the biggest short board fitness has also been a qualitative leap. Once Jokic had technology and vision, but he never had the best energy. And this season, he finished a significant improvement on a very high level. On the defensive side, he is no longer a burden to the team. On the contrary, he can jump out of the three-point line, delay the pick and roll of the other side, change the defense, and return to the basket for the first time. Even if he is not a top defender, his desire for victory gradually improves his defense to the average level of the league. When it comes to the offensive end, it is the stage for him to freely display his talents.

Around him, Murray's road from a scorer to an all-round point guard has become very smooth. Little Potter can mature in a short time. When Murray is injured, campazo can also burst out amazing energy around him. Even little rivers, who has been abandoned by many teams, can become a stable offensive and defensive top soldier in the back of the team. This is the impact of an excellent athlete on the whole team. In the past, we thought that only a good point guard could lead the whole team to progress together. Now, with his unique way of competition, Jokic tells us that the center can do the same.
