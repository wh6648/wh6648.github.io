On June 9, it was reported that the 76ers easily beat the Hawks 118-102 with the excellent performance of enbid in the just concluded match between the 76ers and the hawks at home in the Eastern Conference semi-final, bringing the total score to 1-1.

At the beginning of the first quarter, the 76ers showed a completely different mental outlook from the first game. First of all, the defensive intensity was significantly improved, resulting in the eagles' frequent ironing, which soon made a perfect 20-4 start and laid the tone for the whole game. Since then, although the Hawks several times through the substitute player's excellent outside feel to fight back, but at every critical moment, enbid can always come forward to attack hard to stabilize the situation. Entering the fourth quarter, Milton, who had been lukewarm before, suddenly broke out. In half a quarter, he even got 8 points to help the 76ers open the gap, which also laid the foundation for the main team to return to the field.

Even though nbid suffered from knee injury before the series, he is still a big problem that the eagles can't solve. He made 13 of 25 shots, went to the free throw line 16 times, scored a playoff high of 40 points, and scored 13 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. In contrast, the Hawks interior duo Collins and Capella add up to only 18 points. The Hawks have to place all their hopes on Trey young. However, Ben Simmons has played a huge role in this game. Although his personal data is not good-looking, he has been defending Trey Yang for a long time, making the latter only hit 1 of 7 three-point shots. Not only did he not continue the magic of the first game, but also did not lead his teammates.

Of course, the 76ers still exposed some hidden dangers in this game, and the most obvious one was that the substitute team was not stable enough. After the first half of the game, the Hawks bench score has come to 32 points, but the 76ers substitute did not get a point, if not for Milton's outbreak in the second half, I'm afraid that the 76ers main team still need to wrestle with their opponents until the last moment. Starting from the first round, the depth of the Hawks' bench is one of their major characteristics. Gallinari, Hult and Luwei all have good independent offensive ability. On the contrary, if the 76ers can't output stably at the offensive end, they will bring more pressure to the injured and sick enbid.
