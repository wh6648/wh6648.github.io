On June 9, the NBA announced the results of this season's regular season MVP vote today. Denver Nuggets star Nikolay Jokic (91 first votes) won the award by a landslide. It is worth mentioning that the Nuggets were holding a team meeting at that time, and then received a video from the NBA official. NBA President Xiao Hua announced that Jokic was elected MVP of this season's regular season.

"To be honest, I didn't even want to enter the NBA," Jokic said in an interview with TNT's "inside the NBA" program after winning the award. "When I play basketball in my hometown, my goal is to step on the stage of the European League, because it's the closest top league game to my country. I can play in some of the clubs in Serbia and go up step by step. But then the Nuggets picked me and it was an opportunity for me to become an NBA player

"The difference this year is that I started the season very well," Jokic continued. "I've played very well all season. I think it's the best season of my life. What's more, I won the MVP trophy. This is the best time of my life. "

In an interview, Jokic also thanks his teammates: "although it's my honor, I can't do it without you. So, you have a lot of credit, you are an important part of it. Thank you, everyone. Thank you

At the 2014 draft conference, Jokic was selected by nuggets in the 41st place in the second round. He is the lowest MVP in NBA history. This is the first MVP in the history of nuggets and the first MVP in the second round show (since 1966). Jokic became the sixth international player in the League to win the MVP in the regular season. Before that, the five players were Janice adtokumbo, Hakim Olajuwon, Steve Nash, Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki. He also became the first center to win the league's highest personal honor since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.

"Thank you (Jokic). The big man is back again. It's a long time since the last big man got the MVP. Thank you very much, child from Serbia. Have you ever thought about winning MVP in NBA one day O'Neill congratulates Jokic on winning the MVP.
