March 29 news, reports from the U.S. media, informed sources revealed that Celtic team is expected to consider signing DeMarcus - corsing, to supplement the depth of the front line-up.

Before that, the green army had been pursuing Andre Drummond, but "Zhuang Shen" made a decision today to join the Lakers. In this way, the green army can only focus on other big men.

Sources said the Celtics were once regarded as Zhuang Shen's favorite team on Friday and Saturday local time. Unfortunately, in the end, Zhuang Shen decided to join hands with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

On February 24, the Rockets officially announced the dismissal of koshins. The Rockets signed a one-year non guaranteed contract with cousins during the off-season. It's worth mentioning that the Rockets cut the contract of koshins after it was converted into full guarantee, that is, koshins got the full amount of $2.3 million after it was cut.

This season, koshins played 25 games for the Rockets, averaging 9.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists.

At the beginning of this month, there were rumors that the Blazers were not interested in signing koshins.
