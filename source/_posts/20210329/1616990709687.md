On March 29, it was reported that LaMarcus Aldrich joined the Brooklyn nets, which made brownie, the eldest son of LeBron James, the superstar of the Los Angeles Lakers, very unhappy. Recently, he updated his personal social media to express his dissatisfaction.

The Lakers, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat have been waiting for a long time. As a result, LaMarcus Aldrich finally chose the nets team with more hope of winning the championship. A team with Kevin Durant, James Harden, Carey Owen, Blake Griffin and Jordan Jr. now has an all-round power forward. I'm afraid no one in the League will envy the star shining of the nets.

There is no doubt that the nets become the biggest threat to the defending champion of the Lakers. Although Aldrich is no longer at the peak, he is still an important member of the nets team led by Durant, harden and Owen. However, Aldrich joined the nets to make LeBron James' eldest son Brownie very dissatisfied.

"All this is to stop a 36 year old man who has been in the League for 18 years." Brownie took a front view of LeBron James and wrote.

Aldrich averaged only 25.9 minutes and 13.7 points this season, both of which were the lowest since the rookie season, but his data per 36 minutes were 19.1 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.2 blocks.
