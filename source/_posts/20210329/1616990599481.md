March 29 news, reports from the U.S. media, informed sources revealed that after 48 hours of clarification period, Andre Drummond decided to sign with the Lakers.

Sources said that on Friday and Saturday local time, the Celtics were once regarded as Zhuang Shen's favorite team, but Zhuang Shen could not refuse to become the starting point of a team that had proved its strength, and become the focus of the whole Lakers in the absence of LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

It is reported that after coming to Los Angeles, Zhuang Shen will become the starting center of the Lakers.

It is worth mentioning that the New York Times reporter mark Stein has revealed before that the Lakers are very optimistic that they will get Zhuang Shen.

Zhuang Shen has played 25 games for the Cavaliers this season, averaging 28.9 minutes, 17.5 points, 13.5 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.2 blocks.

NBA salary expert Bob Max followed up and reported that Zhuang Shen and the Cavaliers reached a buyout agreement and lost a total of 794500 dollars, which is just his salary this season after signing with the Lakers.

Because of last year's off-season use of the two-year exception to sign Wesley Matthews, the Lakers this season has triggered a hard salary cap. At present, Zijin team is 954300 US dollars away from the hard salary cap, so they still have enough salary space to sign the 15th player.

The Lakers are expected to use their last line-up to pursue a 3D flanker after signing Zhuang Shen, according to the Olympic.
