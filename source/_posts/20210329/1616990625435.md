Is the NBA going to have a grand finale again? Will the nets be the next super team after the Golden State Warriors? This is an issue that many experts and fans have been discussing fiercely in the past two days.

Indeed, with Griffin and Aldrich signing the nets through buyout and base salary, Brooklyn has assembled a set of five All-Star All-Star starting array. If little Jordan is included, then the lineup of the nets has even reached the six giants configuration.

Indeed, since harden joined in January this year, the nets have quickly shown the appearance of a super team. They have risen all the way in the scoreboard, and now they have caught up with the 76ers, ranking second in the East. So far this season, the average offensive efficiency of the nets is the first in the league, the average score is the second, and the average shooting rate is also the first in the league. All these data prove the strength of the nets and continue to inject confidence into them.

However, if we only use the above facts to equate the nets with the championship, it is obvious that we are blind and too hasty.

It is undeniable that the net's jump to the top teams in the East began with harden's joining. After more than two months in his new club, harden has raised his fighting power and his understanding of basketball to a higher level. With his improvement, the basketball net record is also rising. Up to now, harden has played 31 games in the net, averaging 26 points per game, which is lower than that in previous years. However, his two indexes, averaging 11.4 assists and 8.9 rebounds per game, have both created career highs.

In the series of harden, the potential of the role players of the nets is also activated. Joe Harris, Jeff Green, shamette, and even Bruce Brown, Clarkston, who were relatively unfamiliar names before, ushered in the highlight of their career because of the guidance of mustache. It was also during the period when harden led the team that the nets gradually found the balance between attack and defense, and d'antony's unlimited defense exchange system in the Rockets period was finally recaptured in the hands of his disciple Nash.

But in fact, although the nets are playing now, but the big list is constantly changing, it is necessary to bring new tests to the coaching staff. At present, Owen and Durant are still high hanging exemption card, Griffin and Adelaide are not familiar with the team's system. In the future, once these four people are fully recovered, how to arrange their positions and how to integrate all of them to form an ideal chemical reaction will be no less difficult than an Olympic mathematics competition.

In the absence of Durant and Owen, harden averaged 38.5 minutes per game, which is a new record in his personal career, and also far ahead of the league. Once the two return, bearded no longer so hard, but the ball is bound to be reduced, the rhythm of the attack may be disrupted.

Griffin and Adelaide used to be the top power forwards in the past. They condescended to join the nets for the championship, which is true. However, the star's self-esteem, will they be willing to give up the original team status, willing to play as a substitute, willing to do tactical rotation Engineer? Two players are outstanding offensive talent, but there are a lot of problems in defense, in the future, these two people can adapt to the basketball net unlimited defense system?

Of course, the arrival of Adelaide and Griffin is bound to squeeze the living space of other players in the team. For less playing time, more humble role, the original supporting roles of the nets can accept it?

In addition, the paper strong, not necessarily will transform into enough combat power, especially the playoffs combat power, such things are common in the past. In the eastern part of this year, the playoff competition is perhaps the most intense in the past 20 years. In addition to the nets, the 76ers, bucks, heat, green shirt, and even the younger hawks and Knicks are likely to become the factors that disturb the overall situation.

In other words, putting together a luxury lineup is only an important step for the nets to win the championship, but next, there are still many difficulties and challenges waiting for them. (Poirot)
