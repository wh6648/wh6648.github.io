March 29 news, reports from the U.S. media said that the Nets coach Steve Nash gave an interview after training today. Nash revealed that Kevin Durant is expected to be absent for at least a week.

Nash said that KD participated in the team's 4-on-4 training today. KD suffered a hamstring injury in his left leg against the warriors on February 14 and has been absent since. KD is expected to be out for at least another week due to a hamstring injury.

Talking about Durant's recovery progress, Nash said: "now the team has been in win mode, so it gives KD time to recover slowly. From the team's point of view, we always put KD's long-term health in the first place. We hope he can keep his best in the playoffs

"For now, KD is in great shape, he is improving every day, but we still need to take some measures to monitor and test his recovery progress," Nash continued. "He will definitely come back to us, but next week is almost impossible."

So far this season, KD has played 19 regular season games, averaging 35.7 minutes, 29.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.4 blocks.

Nash also talked about Carey Owen. Owen is expected to be back in Tuesday's home game against Wolves. Before that, Owen missed three games for personal reasons.
