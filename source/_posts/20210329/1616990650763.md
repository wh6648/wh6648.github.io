On March 29, according to mark Haynes, Golden State Warriors star Stephen curry may be back in tomorrow's home game with the Chicago Bulls.

"Stephen curry took part in all the training of the team today. In the injury report of tomorrow's game between warriors and bulls, curry's condition is questionable (50%). This is undoubtedly a good sign for curry, who missed five games due to his tailbone contusion." Reporter mark Haynes reports.

Curry was injured in the game against the rockets on March 18 and was diagnosed with a contusion of the caudal vertebrae. Since then, he has missed five games in a row. In 39 games for warriors this season, curry averaged 29.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game, averaging 4.7 three-point shots per game. The warriors are 22-24, ranking 10th in the West.
