On May 24, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued, with the Phoenix Suns playing the Los Angeles Lakers at home. In the whole game, the Suns have a more obvious advantage in the interior, with 14 more rebounds than the Lakers. In addition, the Suns also do a better job in the overall series of the whole team. In the end, the Suns beat the Lakers 99-90 and made a good start to the series.

At the beginning of the game, the Suns repeatedly attacked the inside line of the Lakers. At the beginning of the game, Aton showed a good state, constantly challenging Nongmei and Zhuangshen. With Eaton's continuous scoring, Booker and Paul have gained more offensive space in the outside line, and Booker has also used his fiery hand to help the Suns get a direct lead.

In the whole game, the Suns' protection of rebounds is obviously stronger than that of the Lakers. The Suns won 47 rebounds in the whole game, while the Lakers only had 33. Among them, the Suns grabbed 16 offensive rebounds in the restricted area of the Lakers, six times more than the Lakers, while Eaton contributed 16 rebounds in this game.

In addition to the impact of the inside line and the protection of the rebounds, the Suns can maintain the integrity in the attack. Booker and Paul repeatedly used the impact of the inside line to attract the opponent's defensive attention, and then the team-mates who divided the ball also appeared many times in the game. Booker and Aton connected to assist the latter to finish the slam dunk easily, which made the Laker's defensive end difficult.
