Then he scored two three points in a row at the top of the arc to help the Lakers establish the lead.

At the end of the first quarter, the Lakers were seven points behind the suns.

Entering the second quarter, James took on the important task of organizing the attack. After he rushed into the interior to make up for the basket, he made many wonderful passes to help Harrell cause damage many times. The attack of the Los Angeles team improved a lot under the series of James, but they ignored each other on the defensive side. They had nothing to do with the sun's tacit understanding of the pass ball. After half-time, the Los Angeles team still lagged behind the sun 45-53.

James set an example in improving the strength of the defensive end, steals Claude and assists Schroeder with a long pass, and then scores three points on the right wing. In the middle of this section, James scored with two hands. First, he caused damage under the basket and made two free throws. Then he made a wonderful pass to assist and scored easily. But after his rest, the Lakers were hit by their opponents again. At the end of the third quarter, the Lakers are 13 points behind the suns.
