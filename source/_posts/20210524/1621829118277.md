May 24 news, as the absolute core of the 76ers, Joel - enbid's performance is still stable. Today, he only played 29 minutes and 46 seconds, 9 of 16 shots, 12 of 13 free throws, 30 points and 6 rebounds, 3 assists and 1 block. The positive and negative value on the court was + 20, the highest in the whole game.

Ben Simmons' performance is not bad, even though he doesn't have a good performance in shooting. Throughout the game, Simmons had 6 points, 15 rebounds, 15 assists, 1 steals and 1 blocks in 3-for-9 shots, with a positive and negative value of + 18, the second in the team. Gemini played at both ends of the offensive and defensive, helping the 76ers make a good start in the first game of the series.

Nbid is one of the top MVP candidates this season. Through this battle, we can see that "the great emperor" has created great trouble for the Wizards in the interior. He made a total of 9 fouls, 13 fouls on the free throw line and 12 free throws. You know, the Wizards have only 15 free throws and 12 free throws. That is to say, in the free throw line, enbid is equivalent to the whole team of the Wizards! This is the role and value of enbid. When the emperor takes the ball in the low position, it often causes great trouble for the Wizards.

In fact, in the first half, enbid was troubled by fouls, early because of three off the court break. With only nine points in the first two quarters, enbid opened up in the second half. In the fourth quarter, he made three consecutive rounds of central shots to help the 76ers consolidate their lead. With 21 points in the second half, the emperor became a nightmare for Washington.

In contrast, the playoffs once again magnified Simmons's short board. As we all know, Simmons biggest short board is not in the long shot. So coming to the playoff stage, Simmons is usually targeted by opponents. Today, Simmons rebounds and assists are very good, only poor shooting. Yes, he only got six points out of three of nine. The most important thing is that Simmons didn't get into the free throw line six times. If four of these six free throws can be scored, Simmons will complete his third triple double in his playoff career.
