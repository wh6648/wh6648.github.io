On May 24, the Suns beat the Lakers 99-90 to make a good start in the first round series of the playoffs, leading the Lakers 1-0.

Suns core Chris Paul in the second quarter with 9:19 when teammate Cameron Johnson collided, suffered a right shoulder contusion. However, Paul returned to the dressing room for treatment and immediately returned to the field. After the game, Paul talked about his injury in an interview.

"My shoulders are OK, I just want to play the whole game. I'm not sure yet, I haven't looked back at the video, Paul said. When asked if he would play in G2, Paul replied, "absolutely, that's no problem."

Suns coach Monty Williams also talked about Paul's injury after the game, "I don't know what happened specifically, I only know that he (Paul) felt pain at that time. You can see the struggling expression on his face. I love him and trust him very much. It gives us a lot of motivation and a lot of ability to see him back on the court. It's really inspiring to see him back on the court Monty Williams said, "after the game, I had a communication with Paul, he should be able to continue to fight in the subsequent games."

"We came forward to respond. Paul has always been our leader. It's very difficult to see him fall to the ground in pain, but he is a fighter and we are a team full of fighters all the time." Devon Booker said of Paul.

"I'm ready for that," Booker said of his playoff debut. I'm very excited about today's game. My last six seasons have been for this moment

"It's the most intense game I've ever played in my career. I spend most of my time keeping calm and focusing on what I should do," he said
