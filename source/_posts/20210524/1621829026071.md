On May 24, the Lakers lost to the Suns 90-99, trailing the Suns 0-1 in the first round of the playoffs. After the game, all the members of the Lakers were interviewed by the media.

"For me, the first game was always about feeling. I'm looking forward to breaking tonight's form. Tomorrow, we will study the video of the game and analyze it together to prepare for the second game James said after the game, "it's a 'fuzzy' season, but every season is a challenge, we just need to get better."

When asked if Paul's tug was a dangerous move, James didn't go straight back and said, "I'll be ready for the second game."

For their own performance, Anthony Davis is obviously very dissatisfied¡° The way I played today, we didn't have a chance to win the game, let alone the series, it's my responsibility. I lost a lot of shots, we lost a lot of shots. But we will be ready for Tuesday local time. I know I'll get better and better, I know we'll get better the second time Davis said.

On Davis' initiative to take responsibility after the game, James said: "I like ad (Davis) to dare to take this responsibility, but this is not a person's responsibility. I like ad putting pressure on himself, when he's aggressive, we'll be a better team... But all of us have to be better as well. He will respond in the second game. When ad is himself, we are the real Lakers

In addition, the Lakers coach Vogel also accepted the media interview after the game, "we will study the video, will respond, just like last season, come out of the defeat, quickly rebound. We still have a lot to improve, but I have confidence in our players Vogel said.

At the same time, Vogel also talked about Paul's foul on James, "Paul used a dangerous foul on James, and the whole team of the Lakers supported James." Vogel said.
