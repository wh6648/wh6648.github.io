On April 10, it was reported that LeBron James, the leading star of Los Angeles Lakers, had been absent for 10 consecutive games due to high ankle sprain. During this period, the Los Angeles Lakers were also in a struggle, only 4-6, and the team's ranking in the western region began to decline. Some people doubt that the injury may be the beginning of the downhill career of James, 36. Mark Medina, reporter of USA today, interviewed some famous medical experts to analyze James' injury. Here are some ideas about James' injury and recovery:

"I hope that when he (James) is fully recovered, he should be in the same condition as he was before the injury." "In the short run, it's bad news, but in the long run, it's good news," said David Gail, an orthopedic doctor and sports medicine expert

"Recovery from such injuries usually leaves few sequelae." Plastic surgeon and foot / ankle specialist Michael carloslo said, "for ordinary ankles and high ankle sprains without any surface instability, they can be fully recovered and will not lead to any long-term problems. What you can do is give the ankle enough time to recover and stabilize

"In the long run, players can usually recover and eventually return to the level of their previous sport "It's not like a broken Achilles tendon. We're worried that they may not be able to recover," said Jonathan Kaplan, a foot and ankle surgeon at Hogg Institute of plastic surgery
