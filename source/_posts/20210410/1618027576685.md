April 10 news, reports from the U.S. media, the nets superstar Kevin Durant in a twitter interview, talked about his teammates.

So far in his career, KD has played for the thunder team (including the former supersonic team), the Warriors team and the basketball nets team.

"There is no doubt that Stephen (curry) and clay (Thompson) are the strongest shooters I have ever worked with," Durant said of the shooters he has worked with. (Joe) Harris is following, and he's chasing greatness. "

Durant won two of the championships in his three years with the warriors. In the summer of 2019, KD will shoot the nets with a free turn. Now, Harris is KD's teammate in the nets. It is worth mentioning that Harris has hit 48.4% of the three-point ball this season.
