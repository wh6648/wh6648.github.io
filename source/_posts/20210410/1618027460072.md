Recently, the Bucks have been in a low state. They have lost two games because of injury. Today, the team has lost a set of starting lineup directly, with hollerdy, Middleton, dallo and di Vincenzo unable to play. The fighting power of the whole bucks also fell to the bottom.

As soon as the game comes up, the performance of the bucks is good, and the attack and defense are all similar. How can the Hornets tolerate a team made up of substitutes to go wild on their own head, and also put a lot of energy into the game. When the two sides come up, they will attack each other. It's really exciting. But with bridges hit three points, the Hornets began to grasp the rhythm of the field, playing a wave of 9-0 to lay the lead. In the second half of the first quarter, the Bucks began to lose power in attack, and long-time shooting led to the score falling behind. Seeing that the score difference was about to reach double digits, sanasis and Forbes continued to score, using a wave of 7-2 to catch up with the score, and fixed the score in the first quarter at 27-32.

In the second quarter, the Hornets began to work hard, making a 10-2 start in the three-point series, and the difference was also pulled to double digits. In the second quarter, the Bucks made a lot of mistakes. They were cut, robbed and even lost the ball without pressure, which gave the Hornets too many chances to score easily. Seeing the game going to garbage time, Bucks shooters suddenly broke out, playing a wave of 11-3 to narrow the difference to 7 points in one fell swoop, but Rozier was not outdone, even in two three points to open the difference again to 10 points. After that, both sides had their own attack and defense, and the difference was always maintained at about 10 points. With bridges hitting the layup, the Hornets led 66-55 in the half.

The Yi side fought again and the two sides began to attack each other. On this side, tieg scored 4 points in a row by breaking through and seizing, while on this side, Graham scored three points in a row from the outside line. Fortunately, in terms of the Bucks, Walla had a good hand. He made a series of hits from outside the three-point line to help the Bucks grasp the score. However, with the outbreak of Rozier, one person scored 7 points in a row to help the Hornets widen the difference. Although the bucks are also working hard to catch up with the points, the team's current lineup is really unable to level the difference of 15 points. At the end of the third quarter, Werner meek made a slam dunk with bridges, and the Hornets also pulled the score to 100-81.

At the end of the game, the Bucks didn't give up. They made a 7-2 start. But then Aden and Graham poured a basin of cold water on the bucks with two three points, and the difference came to 20 points. In the subsequent game, both sides attack and defend each other, but the score has never been further reduced. Although the performances of Walla and Forbes are dazzling, the Bucks' current players obviously can't achieve a turnover in the face of the stronger Hornets. In the end, the Bucks lost 119-127 to wasps and suffered three consecutive losses.

Bucks start: Bobbie pottis, brin Forbes, Jeff Teague, Jordan Walla, sanasis adtokumbo.
