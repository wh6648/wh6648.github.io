On March 18, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued. The Dallas Lone Ranger fought the Los Angeles Clippers at home again. After the whole game, the lone ranger 105-89 defeated the clippers and completed his revenge. Dong Qiqi scored 42 points, 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 steals and 2 blocks, becoming the most brilliant person in the whole game.

Recently, the momentum of the lone Rangers is very good. Although they lost to the Clippers on the field, their 7-3 record in the past 10 games still ensures their position in the top eight in the West.

More importantly, after two days of adjustment, the lone ranger has a chance of revenge. Once again against the clippers, Dong Qiqi took a completely different attitude from the beginning.

The lone ranger first attack, Dong Qiqi dribble calmly, and then a wonderful pass to find polzingis, the latter three break up the knife into the flat.

Next, Dong Qiqi opened the singles mode again, he made a three-point advance simply, and his backward step jump shot was also quite unsolved. Of course, in addition to scoring, Dong Qiqi is still able to switch between passing and single challenge, which makes it difficult for the Clippers to deal with defense.

In many previous games, some teams suffered the loss of attacking Dong Qiqi. They blindly poured too much energy into Dong Qiqi, but it led to the situation that the lone ranger blossomed more and all the people were fighting. Therefore, this night, the Clippers adopted a different strategy in dealing with Dong Qiqi. They focused on blocking Dong Qiqi's passing route and taking care of every player who ran without the ball.



Even so, the Clippers still failed to be vigilant. In the third quarter, Dong Qiqi continued to shuttle leisurely in the opponent's defense. And just over half of the third quarter, he made a breakthrough and shot well, scoring 30 points.

Although, at the end of the third quarter, Paul George scored two three-point goals in a row to continue the life of the clippers, although, at the end of the third quarter, the Clippers' attack improved, especially Cary also hit a few superstar goals. However, they can only become the background of Dong Qiqi.
