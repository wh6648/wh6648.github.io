On March 18, it was reported that a shooting case against Asian Americans occurred in Atlanta recently, which resulted in the death of six Asian women, causing widespread concern. At present, a number of NBA players have come forward to voice for the Asian community and denounce hate crimes against Asian Americans.

Wade: "we can't be silent."

James's teammate Kyle Kuzma also wrote: "there is more than one race being discriminated against. It's really sad to see so much hatred among human beings. Every time there's a shooting in America, it always looks like this... Coward. "

"It's heartbreaking... Pray for our world," Santa Cruz warriors guard Shuhao Lin tweeted late this night. To all Asian American families, we must stand up, speak up, unite and fight for change. We can't give up hope. "

In the past year, hate crimes against Asian Americans have risen sharply in the United States. As early as August, stop AAPI hate organization, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups, reported more than 2500 acts of racial discrimination against Asian Americans.
