On March 18, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued. The Houston Rockets played at home against the Golden State Warriors. After the game, the Rockets lost 94-108 to the warriors and swallowed 18 consecutive losses, creating the team's longest consecutive loss record.

On the warriors side, Stephen curry got 18 points, 5 rebounds and 8 assists, only 2 3-pointer and 11 shots. At the end of the third quarter, curry fell to the ground after a shot and bruised his tailbone, which was a pity to withdraw from the game.

Recently, the warriors have been on a roller coaster ride. They can easily bring down the first jazz in the League on a hot night. But also in some feel inaccurate night, was beaten by the opponent to flee.

It's no wonder that even curry, who is always easygoing, was furious and publicly criticized the whole team.

Of course, there is no reason for the warriors not to win this game in Houston. After all, before today's game, the Rockets have swallowed 17 consecutive wins and become the worst team in the league.

In the first quarter, curry didn't rush to attack himself. First, he put his energy into the defensive end. A clever steal taught little Potter a lesson. Then, curry held the ball and pushed forward to the front court. In the face of the tight defense of the Rockets, he easily fed Wiggins to score.

After that, the pie eater changed to curry. He played a tacit cooperation with dream chasing green. He cut back to the basket with a very clear idea. Sooner or later, the dream chasing pass was delivered. Curry received the ball, lay up and scored in one go.



You know, on the ball, curry has just become the team's history of assists king, inspired by this, this game, his passing desire is still not abated. In a single quarter, curry sent out three assists, while in the second reading stage of the first quarter, mengshen made a breakthrough and shot well, and his personal score exceeded double digits.

With just one quarter, the warriors easily set the winning tone.

In this case, curry's desire for fury is naturally reduced, so he will inevitably slack off in the following games. However, the water in the Curie did not affect the attack and defense of the warriors. In the series of dreams, warriors bloom more, and awesome Wiggins, Wu Bray and Jordan Poole.

It was not until the second half that curry scored his second three-point goal in the game. However, frankly speaking, he scored 2 out of 11 three points, which was too inefficient. Of course, in front of the warriors' winning trend, when the warriors slowly increase the score, curry is more or less relaxed.

However, excessive relaxation, but led to a small tragedy, before the end of the third quarter, curry in a three-point trial, fell to the bottom, then limped back to the dressing room.
