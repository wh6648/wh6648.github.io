May 5 news, reports from the U.S. media, informed sources revealed that the Lakers superstar LeBron James due to right ankle injury, is expected to miss may 7 and 8 against the clippers and the Blazers back-to-back game.

James is also likely to miss more games because his right ankle needs a rest, sources said. James and the Lakers will continue to evaluate, and they will handle injuries carefully as they prepare for the playoffs.

It has been pointed out that since his comeback, James has experienced some difficulties in making powerful air cuts and explosive moves.

The Lakers lost to the Raptors on May 3. In the fourth quarter of that game, James returned to the dressing room with an injury. Then the Lakers officially announced that James was out of the game with a sore right ankle. Then James missed Tuesday's game with the Nuggets.

The situation is a little tense for the Lakers. After beating the Nuggets, the purple gold team's record is 37-28, ranking fifth in the western region, but only one game ahead of the pioneers, who are No.7 in the western region. The two teams will face each other on May 8.

Obviously, the Lakers had to make a plan for the playoff playoffs. James has previously said: "if I do not return to 100% or close to 100% in the end, then the ranking is not important."
