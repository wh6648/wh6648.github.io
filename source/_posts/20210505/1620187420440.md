A 40 + performance loss plus being blocked by the letter brother, although the nets don't care about the ranking of the playoffs, they still need to pay attention to potential opponents in the playoffs, especially the bucks. On May 5, 2021, the nets lost 118-124 to the bucks. Durant scored 32 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 blocks in the second game with the bucks.

After the perfect attack and defense, the net caught up with 1 point, and Durant almost filled the data bar in a single quarter, with 10 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assists and 2 blocks.

Entering the second quarter, Durant once became the core of the organization, constantly assisting his teammates to score, while killing Durant's minimalist attack, instead, let the Bucks unload their strength. In the second quarter, Durant also made a series of offensive fouls by brother Letterman. It's really good-looking for you to come and kill me. The last time MVP played in the same match was in ancient times. Durant's shooting method of "point Kill" in the second quarter made the originally energetic bucks almost dominate the field from organization to attack and defense, And tactically made three fouls.

Almost every time the nets power off, they rely on Durant to continue their lives. Durant's only shortcoming is that he is too selfless at half-time, only nine shots to get 17 points. At the beginning of the second half, Durant scored three more points, and the net continued to chase the points. In the fifth minute of the third quarter, Durant had three people hanging behind and around him.

After the last quarter, the nets suddenly power off, this power off is from Durant, in a few minutes was played 16-1 climax. In the last two minutes of the game, Durant, who was chased and blocked by his opponent for one game, began to exhaust his strength, especially for two consecutive three-point shots, and he almost missed three points in the last time. The camera caught the fans sitting on the sidelines directly lowering their heads, which was very frustrating. Finally, the net lost to bucks, Durant's last exhaustion became the key factor.
