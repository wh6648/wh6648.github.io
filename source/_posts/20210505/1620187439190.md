May 5, 2020-21 NBA regular season continues, Brooklyn nets away to challenge Milwaukee Bucks. At the end of the game, the nets lost 118-124 to the Bucks, swallowing three consecutive losses.

On this side of the net, Owen got 38 points, 3 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks.

Over the past period of time, Owen's state is quite ups and downs, especially in the recent two games, the nets have lost the game, playing against the Bucks, Owen only got 20 points, and the efficiency of 8-for-21 shooting also has a significant gap with his teammate Durant.

Two days later, when the nets play again against the Bucks, Owen certainly hopes that the result will be different. Therefore, from the first quarter, he "starts from me". The nets scored the first four times, three of which are related to Owen. Twice, he went to the basket like a sharp knife and scored. When Owen saw Durant in a better position, his three assists were also accurate.

In fact, because the current net is not complete, therefore, in the overall PK with the Bucks, they did not have an advantage. On the scene, the net is always the passive side.

But this kind of adversity instead inspired Owen's more intense fighting spirit, after the first quarter, he outside three points into the net. And as the attack found rhythm, Owen became more confident. Soon after, he took the ball to the Bucks' defense. He got rid of it calmly and made his signature jump shot into the net steadily.

Owen's outbreak, there is another reason, in his side, new teammate Mike - James recently has a very good play. In the second quarter, when James took the place of Owen, his efficiency was very high and his score was recorded frequently. And that obviously gives Owen a special incentive.

So, after the second quarter, Owen didn't adjust much and hit the three-point goal quickly. Not only is he good at scoring, in the second reading stage of this section, Owen also played a cameo role as the center. He grabbed the offensive rebound in the crowd and made a second attack. Next, he also used the steals to block the opponent's last attack in the half.

Owen had 14 points in the first half, which was obviously enough for some ordinary games. But in this game, facing the Bucks' challenge, the nets need to attack more fiercely.

After receiving the signal and changing sides, Owen continued to change his moves to attack the opponent's position. At the beginning of the third quarter, he made a jump shot and scored 20 points through free throws and three points. thereafter. Owen and Durant almost attack one round, this tacit understanding and self-confidence, also let the nets gradually turn the situation around.

In the third quarter, Owen scored 17 points. In the case of three quarters behind, into the last quarter, the net has the score over.

At the end of the day, however, the Bucks quickly responded to a wave of attacks and regained their advantage. Into the middle of this section, Bucks lead back to more than 10 points. At the critical moment, Durant was obviously tired, but Owen stood up and stopped bleeding for the net with a difficult jump shot. After that, he hit the three-point ball and continued the pursuit of points.
