Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James is expected to miss the clippers and Blazers' next games in an effort to recover his injured right ankle, according to a report earlier today.

James' right ankle needs time to recuperate and he is likely to miss more games, a person familiar with the matter said. James had been out for two weeks with a right ankle injury. After coming back, James felt pain in his ankle in the match with raptors and missed the game against nuggets. James said in an interview that he had a very good ankle reaction during the warm-up after his comeback, but at half-time, he felt stiff and painful.

"My problem is that I need to be healthy and I need to make sure my ankle is back to where it was before the injury James said, "I have to be smart. I'll talk to my trainer Mike mancias, the coaching staff and some players. But the most important thing for me is to be healthy and to be at full strength when it really matters. It's very important for me, you know, because I hate to stand by in the game, I hate not being able to play. But if I don't play with all my strength, I can't help my team

According to Los Angeles Times reporters Dan woike and Broderick Turner, James visited a medical expert in the field of ankle this week. He will be very cautious about coming back and may not return to the game until the team has trained.
