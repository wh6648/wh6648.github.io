In the last game against the nets, brother Letterman scored 49 points and killed all sides. In this season, brother Letterman played MVP, but the team's record is not stable enough. It seems that the bucks are quiet a lot this season, but with brother Letterman, everything is possible. On May 5, 2021, the Bucks beat the nets 124-118 with 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, four three points and 10 free throws.

The letter brother has to say that he is holding his strength to the net, even if he won the game before, but he even wants to win the championship in the East, the net is the real mountain. So after the start, the attack with the same hand feeling became the focus, from three points to hook, from the beginning to defend Durant to misplaced to defend Owen, with a full sense of existence. But after Durant scores unceasingly, the letter finally could not sit still, a three-point, plus a conversion 2 + 1 layup, leads the team to hit the climax.

Four minutes in the first quarter, the letter brother hit another empty three-point. Obviously, the nets didn't believe the letter brother's shot, but in the first quarter, the letter brother hit two three-points, and even sank Griffin directly in the interior. The rolling attack and defense is the foundation of the Bucks' climax. Bucks in the second quarter into a rare three high lineup, letter brother directly played three pairs on Durant, seems to want to fight ahead of Durant consumption, budenhower for younger letter brother more confidence, hope to consume Durant ahead of time.

During this period, Griffin made another three-point shot and a middle shot. Griffin could not compete with him in terms of athletic talent and height. The second quarter 9 minutes, the letter brother in the inner line rolling Griffin again into a 2 + 1 shot. If there's something wrong with the letter brother, it's that he made too much effort in the match with Durant ahead of time and was fouled twice in a row by the opponent. He got into foul trouble ahead of time and broke the tactical deployment of the team.

Fortunately, the letter brother in the last few minutes of the second quarter of the team's trust, up after not only no fouls, but also with Durant's single challenge, with Durant's way of throwing, turning back. At the beginning of the third quarter, he missed three points, grabbed the rebound, and then hit three points again like training. In addition, I have to say that the letter brother's free throw in this game is also very stable, the first six free throws all hit. In the second minute of the third quarter, the net just caught up with a ball gap, and the letter brother rolled Griffin to finish the 2 + 1 shot, and hit the basket again.

This game letter brother's hit rate is not high, but the strike point is light enough, the three-point ball continues to go high, the shooting under the basket and the breakthrough under the pressure in the critical period, really played a great lethality. In the last 51 seconds of the game, the letter brother was sent to the free throw line again, two free throw hits were made steadily, and finally the Bucks won the game. Finally, the Bucks completed the back-to-back double against the nets.
