At the beginning of the season, the pelican of New Orleans fell to the bottom of the western region, then rebounded from the bottom, and gradually recovered. It launched an impact on the playoffs, and pushed to the 11th place in the western region, retaining the hope of the playoffs; Although it's very difficult to get into the playoffs, we can still see the future of this young guard. All this is due to a change in February, coach Stan van Gundy (JVG) let potential star Zion Williamson change his playing style, from the inside scorer to the control forward, which gradually reversed pelican's decline.

Zion has the top physical talent, has the historical level of bounce, speed and explosive power, and is the undisputed champion in the 2019 draft. However, his height is only 1.98 meters, which is a relatively short height in the front line, but he has a huge weight of 129 kg, which is unique in the history of NBA and also brings challenges to his future. For this reason, the pelican team management dismissed former head coach Jean Terry and replaced him with JVG. This is because JVG once coached all star centers such as O'Neill, Howard and Zhuangshen. Howard and Zhuangshen are his disciples.

However, at the beginning of the season, the famous coach's performance was surprising, and his record fell to the bottom of the western region. He used Adams (or Hayes) to play double towers with Zion, but Zion's offensive skills were rough, the attack points were concentrated in the restricted area, and the main attack was no ball (pick and roll, cut and burst or empty cut and smash) or low position attack and hard play; Crushing opponents by weight, speed and speed; However, Adams and Hayes are not strong in scoring. They only eat cakes and lay up. The team no longer depends on the ball holding organization of golfer, but is shared by golfer, bradso, Walker, Ingram and Keira Lewis. But the effect of this method is not good, because the retro twin towers have no range, and the position is too concentrated on the inside line, so they can only attack the inside line. When attacking, the twin towers are filled to block the inside line, which is not conducive to the team's offensive space and teammates' exertion, but also weakens the overall flexibility and mobility. The team moves slowly and slowly, and the defensive end is easy to be targeted by the opponent, The team can only rely on Zion and Ingram to score hard (editor's note: at least one of the great achievements in the history of the twin towers is the inside and outside of the inside, such as Duncan and David Robinson's twin towers, both of which can be inside and outside).

In February of this year, JVG changed Xi'an's lineup from the inside scorer to the ball control forward (control forward) to increase the proportion of Xi'an's holding the ball and add a holding point; When Zion is strong from outside to inside, it can tear up the opponent's defense and create offensive space. The change comes from the pelicans' game against the Bucks led by brother Letterman on January 30, when Zion unexpectedly sent out seven assists to lead the team to defeat their opponents. Van Gundy was inspired and changed the way Zion played.

Zion is strong, skillful in controlling the ball, fast in moving, full of explosive force when breaking through, strong in dunking and killing. It can be said that it is hard and strong, and the Epee has no edge. Even the top defenders such as Ben Simmons can not avoid the fate of being tough and sudden. Zion has good flexibility and coordination, and can skillfully use lateral and European step when breaking through, so he can easily bypass the inner line of the basket; At the end of the game, besides dunking, he can also lick the basket and pick the basket. He can also move the Dodge bar in the air to score. Zion has good passing ability, unselfish style, broad vision of passing, and outstanding leader temperament. With Zion as the control forward, the positions and holding points are more dispersed, which reduces the congestion of the inside line, optimizes the offensive space of the team, and improves the flexibility and mobility. In the system of JVG, Zion and Ingram share the task of the point guard, while golfer and bladeso play the role of the point guard. They join the team together to sort out the attack and achieve multi-point flowering. This is the reason why the pelican's running in is effective and the record is getting better. The attack efficiency rate reaches 114.2 (8th in the League).

This season, Zion averaged 26.9 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists, with 64% of shots. Dallas Lone Ranger coach Carlisle praised him as "Shaquille O'Neill with point guard skills". What's more, he is also the player with the strongest key points in the team. According to statistics, his key points averaged 3.1 points per game, ranking first in the team, with a shooting rate of 59.6%.

Before playing point blank (from December last year to January this year), his assists were only 2.3; After changing to point forward (from February to today), he made 4.2 assists, which can be described as a rapid improvement. He passes the ball most is Ingram and bladeso, the field average assists them each 0.6 times. Before playing the control front, he averaged 9.1 times, scored 6.2 points (52.6%) and sent 0.6 assists; After playing the control forward, he averaged 14.5 times (the top of the team), scored 10.7 points (57.8%) and sent 1.0 assists. Before playing the control front, he touched the ball 54.1 times per game, with an average of 2.1 seconds each time; After the control forward, he touched the ball 66.2 times per game, 3.64 seconds per time.

When we look at the curriculum vitae of Zion, we will find that Zion was born as a point guard. He was born in a basketball family. His father, Latif Williamson, worked as a rugby player in a high school in South Carolina and served as a defensive forward; His mother, Sharon Sampson, was a track and field athlete at the University of Livingston. Zion inherited her father's body and her mother's bounce. His parents divorced when he was five years old, and his mother married his stepfather, Lee Anderson. His stepfather was a basketball player at Clemson University who used to play for NCAA South Carolina. He was a point guard. When Zion was 9 years old, he taught him the skills of point guard hand in hand.

When he was studying at Duke University, he changed to play power forward because of his soaring weight and strong figure. However, the skills he had learned since he was a child have long been well known and never forgotten. So when JVG made him play power forward, he easily adjusted. When he entered the league, there were a lot of comments on the draft template, such as Buckley, Randolph, Griffin... And now Zion has turned to James and brother Letterman. Zion once said that this change was "natural" for him; Pelican operations chief David Griffin also said: "people always think of Zion as a power forward freak, galloping in the paint area. In fact, he grew up clutching the ball Assistant coach Bob Bayer said: "it's amazing how fast the adjustment is. It turns out that he has the ball as well as his score."
