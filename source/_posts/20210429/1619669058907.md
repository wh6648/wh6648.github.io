Three days ago, the two teams had just experienced two duels, while the Blazers were killed by Grizzlies. As the main competitor who wants to avoid entering the playoffs and directly enter the playoffs, the Blazers obviously can not allow such continuous losses; For the Grizzlies, even if they win two games in a row against the Blazers, they still play the role of pursuers from the perspective of winning games.

As soon as the game came up, both sides showed a strong emphasis on the game. Powell took advantage of the pick and roll, while the Grizzlies relied on varan to score the first point. Then the two sides began to attack, the score alternating lead. Half way through the first quarter, the Blazers' excellent outside line configuration began to work, first Powell hit three points in a row, then CJ scored five points in a row to establish a leading edge. Then Lillard put on his watch in the first quarter, scored 10 points in a row, led the Blazers to play a 28-13 super offensive wave, established a 15 point lead at one stroke, and ended the first quarter with 38-23.

In the second quarter, the Blazers' firepower did not decrease. Powell got four points in a row and continued to expand the difference. Grizzlies continuously attacked the Blazers' interior line. Clark and Winslow played under the basket to help Grizzlies stabilize the situation. But CJ is obviously not ready to play a war of attrition with Grizzlies, he first hit the ball from the three-point line, and then used the pick and roll to complete the mid shot. Grizzlies see the situation is not good, decisive packet, but to meet Anthony direct hit three points, forcing Grizzlies can only give up packet strategy. And this also makes CJ completely open, throw three points everything, continuous score will further open the difference, the difference was once opened to 30 points. At the last moment, varan's inner line hit hard to help Grizzlies stop bleeding. But at the end of the half-time, the Blazers had a huge lead, 74-46.

Yi Bian fight again, grizzlies began to chase points, Dillon opened the momentum of Grizzlies chasing points with middle distance, and then Morant and varan continuously attacked the interior line. Although the Blazers were guarded by nurkic in the interior line, they were still difficult to fight against Morant with strong impact and varan with large tonnage. Through the impact on the inside, Grizzlies' outside shooters got more opportunities to shoot empty. The Grizzlies' shooters represented by Allen and Brooks began to work hard and hit three points in a row to help Grizzlies get closer to the score. Although the Blazers also maintain a fairly good efficiency, but in the face of the Grizzlies with hot offensive feel, the shortcomings of the Blazers' strong offensive and weak defensive are exposed. The defensive end has been completely penetrated continuously, and lilard and CJ still have the same hand feeling, helping the Blazers to maintain the lead. With Clarke's smash, the Grizzlies chased the score to 83-102 in the third quarter.

At the end of the game, grizzlies continued to chase points, but the Blazers didn't make too serious mistakes in a row, and Grizzlies general Morant was in poor condition. With Anthony hit three points, grizzlies also replaced, the game also completely lost suspense. In the end, the Grizzlies defeated the Blazers 109-127 at home, swallowing two consecutive losses.

Grizzlies start: Jia - Morant, Dillon - Brooks, Jonas - Valan yunas, Kyle - Anderson, Grayson - Allen.
