April 29 news, South Florida Fox Sports Channel 640 reporter Andy Slater released a scene video of Houston Rockets guard Stirling Brown being attacked in Miami, this video was shot by a Miami police officer's camera.

On April 19 local time, Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. and Stirling Brown patronized a strip club in Miami. Brown got into the wrong car and clashed with many people when he returned to the hotel. It is reported that Brown was beaten by at least three people. He was hit on the head by a bottle of wine and lost a lot of blood. He nearly died.

A Miami police officer's camera captured the scene of Brown's attack. In the video, Brown has been pressing hard on the head wound with his shirt, trying to stop the bleeding. Brown was very angry about this situation and repeatedly asked the emergency personnel to call an ambulance. When he approached the police wearing the human body camera, he could clearly see a large amount of blood oozing from Brown's head to his abdomen. Before Brown was treated by medical staff, he and the police seemed to have a heated discussion.

It is worth mentioning that Brown's teammate little Porter is also one of the players involved in this incident, and he also tried to protect his teammates when Brown was beaten. For some reason, little porter had an argument with the local police. The video shows little Potter waving his arm and gesturing to one of the policemen.

According to the report, little Porter was also "rough treated" when he tried to defend brown. It is reported that the police have edited the video and audio. They said in a document that the audio is currently under public internal investigation, but it is obvious that the two NBA players are very frustrated.

"That's why some of the portable video cameras are muted." Reporter Andy Slater said.

Byron Spruell, President of NBA operations, announced today that Porter was fined $50000 for violating the League health and safety agreement. It should be noted that, according to the famous reporter Marc Stein, although he patronized the strip club with little Porter, Brown is not expected to be fined. Unless there is further information calling for a new investigation, the alliance's investigation into the incident will be officially concluded.
