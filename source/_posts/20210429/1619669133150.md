With the return of the long shot of the magic and the lifting of the ban by Vogel, the announcement of the return of the king also sounded the clarion call of the defending tour of the Lakers. The existence of the heavy eyebrow is still the top priority. On April 29, 2021, the Lakers lost 107-116 to the wizards, scoring 26 points, but failed to counter attack.

From the thick eyebrow back to the dislocation attack mode of the whole game, in fact, it has announced the strong return of thick eyebrow, which is an obvious signal. At the beginning of the game, Nong Mei hit the middle shot again, and through a direct pass without the ball, he made a smash. After the start, Nong Mei seemed to be able to attack at half-time. The first 8 minutes, or Davis, in the right 45 single shot again.

Thick eyebrow in the shot, dislocation, has always been the real meaning of the core of the Lakers to kill. Although the wizard once took the lead in the attack, it was the thick eyebrow that brought up a wave of offensive rhythm. This time, he did not shoot from the position, but directly participated in two fast attacks, one was to catch Kuzma's pass and slam dunk, and the other was to fight back successfully. Once the big man of the Laker team made a quick change, in fact, he had no solution for most teams in the league, Because thick eyebrow, which is tall, can run and can throw, has few.

However, the Lakers also need to fully implement the attack with thick eyebrow as the main line. In the second quarter, thick eyebrow fell down directly because thick eyebrow became the choice of turn back run. It is not wise for the Lakers to have no choice for thick eyebrow when they attack. Thick eyebrow needs to have the ball in hand, not a ball free terminator. So in the last minute of the second quarter, thick eyebrow was in a state of depression and unhappiness. First, he was beaten by his opponent and suffered from an elbow stroke, and then he lost a foul.

In the third quarter, thick eyebrow is still trapped in such a situation, always led by the rhythm of the opponent, even in a defense by the opponent across the button to sweep the eyes, was swept after the elbow, thick eyebrow is really too depressed. In the third quarter, it seems that there are a lot of moves made by Nongmei in 12 times, but in fact, there are too few tactics to effectively attack positions around him. At least half of his attacks are fragmented, and too many useless turn back runs consume his physical fitness in the recovery period.

In the fourth quarter, the Lakers are nearly 20 points behind and can only make a free throw. When the Lakers reestablish their offensive and defensive core with the thick eyebrow, the threat and actual effect can be seen with naked eyes when they pass the thick eyebrow every time. In the last six minutes of the last quarter, Nong Mei made another 45 degree three-point shot, which was the first non bottom corner three-point shot after his comeback. One minute later, he still made a Nong Mei shot, when the Lakers caught up with 9 points. At the end of the whole season, the Lakers used almost all kinds of thick eyebrows to fight against the wizards, but it was too late. Even if they used it in the early quarter, the result might be very different. After the Lakers lost the game, the lone ranger again narrowed down to fifth place in the West.
