April 29 news, Miami Heat legend, future Hall of Fame member Dwyane Wade recently in TNT a program on the warriors superstar Stephen curry made a long positive comment. Wade talked about Curry's impressive possession and how he scared his defenders.

"This [curry] guy is extraordinary," Wade said of curry. "Fear, you'll be a little scared, not afraid of him, but not knowing what he's going to do. He has amazing dribbling ability, can shoot from anywhere, can shoot from the left side, can also shoot from the right side. His pick and roll ability is even more lethal. You can't stop him at all

Indeed, curry is one of the most exciting players of the season. It's not only his long-range ability, but also his performance in the state of no ball, and his ability to create shooting opportunities for his teammates and himself. Curry is an extremely difficult player because he can do a lot of things, even if there are a lot of injuries in the team's lineup, but he continues to be amazing.

"Obviously, I've read all his shooting charts. These are not good shot choices. But I like his ability to shoot, to run without the ball, to pass, and he's a great shooter. He's also a great basketball finisher, and people ignore that because they see his three-point goal. This guy is amazing Wade said.

In the past 36 games, curry has hit 66.7% of the field in 5 feet.
