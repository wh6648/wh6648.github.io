Los Angeles Lakers this season can be described as calamitous, thick eyebrow with tendinitis injury stop, James was Solomon "rolling dragon" injury caused by right ankle high sprain. In the emergency of the regular season, the Los Angeles team once lost in a row. Fortunately, they gradually found a state. They not only defeated Cavaliers, magic, kings, Hornets and other teams, but also defeated the hot nets to keep their place in the playoffs and successfully welcome Davis back. Thanks to coach Vogel, he and his coaching team tiantuan built a civilian system to temporarily replace the original Zhan Mei Star system and help the team overcome the difficulties of no Zhan and no Mei.

The civilian system does not rely on a large number of players to cut points. Players share the ball power and perform their duties. There is no player with a high proportion of points. The strongest civilian system in history is the pistons of Rashid Wallace, Ben Wallace, Billups, Hamilton and Prince, who beat the powerful F4 Lakers to win the championship in 2004. Larry Brown, Sloan, Carlisle, rivers and Vogel are all famous coaches for coaching the civilian system. Vogel's lineup (George, Granger, Ebert, David West, hill and Stephenson) was close to the civilian system when he was teaching the Pacers. The civilian system of today's League is most famous among Pacers (sabonis, Brogden and leville).

The civilian system is based on defense, which is caused by the lack of scoring experts in the team, and the Lakers are no exception. Vogel and his assistants built a solid defense system for the Lakers, which became the foundation of the civilian system. Most of the players configured by the Lakers are good at defense, and Zhuang Shen's fire line joining is timely, which makes up for the loopholes of inside players' expansion and basket protection. Even players who are not good at Defense (such as Maurice, Harrell and mclarmo) can grow and improve. Kuzma, who used to be targeted by opponents, has become one of the core defensive players. The defense system is sound and tight, with layers of defense, encircling and blocking without losing position, so as to ensure that there are people in front of the opponent and not rashly steal, which will force the opponent into the trap of the sideline and end line and destroy the opponent's connection. The defensive strategies of the Lakers are rich, such as man to man, regional joint defense, unlimited defense change, mixed defense (regional mixed man to man) and variable defense (regional and man to man switching). The master level defense makes the Lakers the best team in the league, with the defense efficiency as high as 106, ranking first in the league.

The offensive data of the Lakers is not good, the offensive efficiency is only 109.9 (20th in the League), but considering the current configuration of the Lakers, it is very good.

The attack system of the Lakers originally centered around Zhan Mei. Zhan Mei's sudden injury affected the whole system, which made the role players bear the heavy responsibility. However, Vogel still creates a variety of civilian attacks, such as double towers, one big four small, five small and three guards. It seems to be messy. It's not Kong Yiji's four ways of writing the word "Hui". In fact, it's flexible and methodical (editor's note: last season, the Lakers built a civilian system around Rondo, and beat the thunder when Zhan Mei was absent at the same time).

The Laker takes the little black Schroeder as the first core of holding the ball. Schroeder was originally only good at scoring, not good at organizing. When he was the boss in the Hawks, he could not lead the whole team; In the thunder period, he acted as a bench bandit, and the organizational task fell on Wei Shao or Paul. After trading to the Lakers, he practiced hard in holding the ball, organizing, sudden points and picking and rolling, sharing the pressure of James. After James was injured, he became the "No. 1 ball controller". He not only took on the task of shooting and scoring, and became the first firepower point of the team, but also had to coordinate the whole team to sort out the attack, pick and roll to tear up the opponent's defense. Despite his scoring and organizational instability, he has played a key role. According to statistics, James averaged 16.8 points, hit rate 43.9% (three points 41.4%), assists 7.4 times, organized him to play sudden points and pick and roll. Of course, his scoring is not stable, his ability of organizing to break the bag clip is not good, and the strong defensive team with strong discipline, such as the heat, strangled Schroeder with the bag clip and made him dumb.

Fortunately, Vogel made a backup for the holding point, adding the core tasks of Caruso, Tucker and little Gasol. Caruso and tucker used to be the "auxiliary control" of the occasional fight organization; After Zhan Mei's truce, they shouldered the responsibility of organizing the bench. They can pass the ball and push the fast attack, but their vision is ordinary. Caruso is good at playing pick and roll with Harrell, but he is not creative enough; Tucker is better at using his body to carry away opponents to make sudden points. He has a strong ability to break through and finish. He also has a quick pass, but he is not stable enough. After the two partners can play such as pistol tactics, complementary correction, the effect is also good. Vogel also bold test lineup, on three guards, increase the impact of fire. After Zhan Mei's rest, the proportion of pick and roll tactics of the Lakers increased, and the guards (Schroeder, Caruso and Tucker) ate cake for Harrell and Zhuang Shen's pick and roll pass. In addition, strong and weak side cooperation, no ball cover and so on gradually increased, players patiently pass the ball, play more team.

With the joining of Zhuang Shen, the center configuration of the Lakers overflowed, and little Gasol's position was embarrassed. He gave up his starting position to the young Zhuang Shen. In Zhuang Shen's truce due to toenail injury, little Gasol put on his back in low position, three points in high position, coordination in high and low position, early appearance, and old cold leg became a Scud; Against Celtic, he dislocated his finger and cracked his bone. He still broke it back and continued to fight. It's awe inspiring.

Vogel also increased the proportion of independent attack of Kuzma, Damo and Zhuangshen. Kuzma and Momo originally played without the ball, but now Kuzma has increased the number of singles with the ball, and his big heart three points are killing people; Da Mo increased the proportion of low singles (may be used as a simulation and backup of thick eyebrows). Zhuang Shen just joined the team and got a lot of attention. He often plays back to the body in succession and ends up scoring with a hook or a dunk. He can also receive a pass from a defender and eat cake. Against the nets, he won the match Aldrich.

Vogel is actively helping the shooters get their hands back. The three-point instability and low shooting rate of the Lakers (35.7%, 19th in the League) are due to the short off-season and lack of physical ability, so they are forced to replace training with matches, which affects the players' hand feeling; Then there are the Lakers hoarding tactical shooters, lack of chaos fighting shooters. Fortunately, the Lakers made up for mcclemore, who is good at chopping points in random battles. His arrival also played a catfish effect on pop, Matthews and other shooters.

In addition to Jamie's absence, Schroeder, Maurice, Kuzma and Matthews are also plagued by injuries. Vogel still insists on long rotation to ensure the team's physical fitness and health. Players at the end of the bench such as kakuk, Letterman and McKinney also get the chance to play, which is much better than coaches who overuse stars and starters.

Vogel is famous for his careful preparation before the game. The platoon layout fully discussed with Kidd, Hollins and Phil handy, and designed different preparation plans to deal with different situations. The average difference between the winning and losing of NBA games is only 4 points. The arrangement of platoon troops, on-the-spot command and the adjustment of the game process are very important. Zhuge Woge is worthy of praise, especially the replacement of personnel and the suspension adjustment are just right, and rarely play abnormal. For example, after Zhuangshen joined, Vogel cut Gasol's playing time and increased his attacking power in the interior; On April 11, 2021, when the Lakers played against the nets, Vogel used new recruit mclarmo to score three points in a row. Of course, Qiaofu can't make bricks without straw. The serious injury and poor attack lead to the inability of the Lakers to face the team with strong defense and strong interior line. It's not easy for them to do it.
