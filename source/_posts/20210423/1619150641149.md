Recently, the sun has been in a hot state with six victories in seven battles, and the green army has not been inferior. The recent record of five victories in six battles also shows a good state. As soon as the two sides came up, they didn't give in to each other. On this side, TT's inside line colluded with each other for the first time, and on the other side, including the middle distance mark, the two sides started in the same place, making a 10-11 start. But then the green army took the lead and gained a 12-1 lead. Then they have been taking the initiative, the sun is not outdone, a wave of 10-0 equaliser. With Tatum's last two free throws, Celtic took a 26-21 lead in the first quarter.

The sun suddenly cut off power in the second quarter, and the offensive side could not find the basket at all. Although Celtic's state was not excellent, in the face of some sleepwalking suns, the green army still seized the opportunity. At the beginning, a wave of 9-0 directly stopped the Suns, but the Suns seemed to have no way to deal with it. They didn't get a point in the first four minutes, and the defensive end was also absent-minded and full of holes. Although in the second half of the second quarter, the Suns reluctantly recovered some feeling, but the second quarter of the game, the suns only nearly 37 points, although the green army's offensive state is not ideal, but in the face of such an abnormal suns, the green army or 53-37 with 16 points into the second half.

After Yi Bian fought again, the sun finally regained the feeling of the game. Paul, as the commander, still maintained a stable performance. He first punished TT in the middle distance continuously. After changing the opponent's defensive strategy, he changed his thinking and helped the team score by connecting with Eaton. Under the guidance of Paul, the sun's overall attack was finally revitalized. Through Paul and Aton's pick and roll, Celtic was forced to shrink their defense, which provided more shooting opportunities for the outside shooters. Bridges, Cameron Johnson and other shooters all scored three points, helping the Suns find a feeling at the offensive end. Celtic continue to maintain their play, the end of the third quarter, Celtic to 77-65 lead.

At the end of the season, the Suns continued to chase points. Facing the rising suns, Celtic improved their defensive strength. They obviously arranged Paul's defense. Although Paul still maintained a good hand, under the defensive strategy of Paul and his teammates in the green army, other suns players didn't have a good ability to create opportunities. Although the sun once widened the difference, the green army still withstood the pressure. Tatum scored five points in a row at the time of the pass and pulled the difference back to double digits. At the last moment, smart steals the key, and the sun also completely loses the chance to fight back. In the end, Celtic beat the Suns 99-86, ending the opponent's two consecutive wins.

Celtic start: Jason Tatum, kenba walker, Marcus smart, Tristan Thompson, Romeo Langford.
