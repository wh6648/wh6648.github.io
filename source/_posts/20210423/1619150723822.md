On April 23, Los Angeles Laker owner Jennie bass revealed in the podcast "all the smoke" that it was not Kobe Bryant who sent Shaquille Olney away, but purely money.

In the fall of 2003, the Lakers held a training camp in Hawaii. The team owner Jerry bass (who died in 2013) was sitting on the sideline of the University of Hawaii to watch a preseason game. Shaquille O'Neal was playing an important game. After a dunk, he ran to the sideline and said to bass, "now you have to pay me?" It was this contract, not Kobe, that allowed the Lakers to trade Shaquille O'Neal to Miami.

"O'Neal wanted to get a big contract, but my father (Jerry bass) didn't want to pay him so much, so the team made the decision to trade O'Neal. A lot of people think it's Kobe's reason, but it's not the case. It's just about the money Jennie Bass said on the podcast.

After Phil Jackson announced to join the Lakers and the introduction of the famous triangle tactics, the strength of the Lakers led by O'Neal and Kobe Bryant is booming, and they even achieved the feat of three consecutive titles in 2000-2002. However, although they have achieved unprecedented success, the win did not let the Laker finally give up O'Neal's decision. In the summer of 2004, after the Lakers lost to the pistons in the finals, they traded O'Neal to the heat, and the OK team was broken up. And the old buss finally bet on the young and promising Kobe.
