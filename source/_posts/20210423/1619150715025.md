Philadelphia 76ers superstar Joel enbid believes he is building a strong case to become the MVP of this season's regular season. In fact, the superstar believes his election is beyond doubt.

"No doubt, I am MVP." Enbid told reporters shams charania.

For enbid, this can be attributed to three factors: the attention of the opposing defenders to him, his influence on the 76ers, and his team's current ranking - first in the East.

"I've been dominant all season, I feel that every time I hold the ball, the other side always sends three people to defend me, but I can still do what I'm good at. When you see our ranking and my data, I think I deserve the best defensive team. My dominant performance is reflected in both attack and defense. The team is also ranked first in the East. Last year and the year before last MVP letter brother (Janice - adtokumbo), he is also good offensive and defensive, and the team has a very good record Said enbid.

"We thought a lot after we were swept last season and lost. We need to find a way to win. Disrespect and frustration motivate me, so we need to be stronger and prove ourselves again Enbid continued.

But while enbid brags boldly about his achievements, others are equally adamant about being nominated for MVP.

Prior to this, Golden State Warriors star Stephen curry also expressed almost the same view when participating in the program¡° I mean, I have to be MVP. I may not get it, but it doesn't matter. " Curry said.

Similarly, Denver Nuggets head coach Mike Malone also believes that team center Nikolay Jokic should get the MVP¡° Life is a small moment. Nicholas (Jokic) has 56 moments to prove that he is MVP. " Mr Malone said.

It is worth mentioning that commentator Olney also talked about his MVP of this season in the program today, "now I will choose Joel enbid, who has played the performance that should be played, and his average score is also higher than that of Jokic. Enbid is better, but the two are almost the same, he is 10, joachi is 9.9762541, very close O'Neill said.
