On June 28, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. The Milwaukee Bucks are in the third game of the Eastern Conference finals with the Atlanta Hawks. At the end of the game, the Bucks reversed the Hawks 113-102, leading 2-1 in the series.

Back at home, the eagles showed a different mental outlook.

Of course, in addition to the spiritual level, in the tactical level, they have also changed. As a team with strong attack and weak defense, the Hawks' defense efficiency in the regular season is beyond 20 in the league. Therefore, there is no way to rely on defense to limit the bucks.

So, at the beginning of today's game, the eagles decisively changed their strategy. They resolutely attacked the bucks. On the defensive side, they no longer expected to do everything. Instead, they tried to limit the Bucks' outside firepower, but let their inside attack go.

This strategy has achieved very good results.

In the early part of the first quarter, the Hawks, except for Capella, all four starters have already scored three-point goals. With the team blossoming more points, the burden on the core Trey Yang is also lightening. He can blow Yang more freely and score more quickly. Therefore, he scored double early and hit the logo three-point goal in the first and second quarters.

However, after experiencing the last round of seven games with the nets, Bucks' spirit is different after all. Even if, the Hawks home momentum a wave higher than a wave, even if the Hawks offensive wave after wave, but the Bucks almost every time will be able to score.

Before half-time, the Bucks responded to a 10-0 attack and returned to the dressing room with a draw. After Yi Bian, when the eagle set off a climax again, the Bucks still took it easy.

The Bucks' ease brought them a turn for the better. At the end of the third quarter, Trey young stepped on the referee's foot after an attack, sprained and was forced to return to the dressing room.

Although, at the end of the festival, blowing Yang staged the return of the king. But everyone knows the impact of a sprained ankle on his state. And with blowing Yang gradually dumb fire, the eagle's attack has become fragmented, not angry.

On the contrary, on the Bucks side, Middleton, the second leader, broke out all the energy accumulated in the first three quarters in the last quarter. He was almost unstoppable in his consecutive shots. In a single quarter, Milwaukee scored 20 points, and the game completely became the stage for him to perform alone.

I have to admit that this night, the eagles did their best in all aspects. However, because of the accident of blowing Yang and the sudden outbreak of rice God, the balance of victory and defeat finally fell to the bucks.
