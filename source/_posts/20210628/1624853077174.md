June 28 news, the New York Knicks has been with Julius Randall to discuss a mutually beneficial contract extension. The Knicks could offer Randall a four-year, top salary contract worth $106 million this summer, but some agents and rival teams think Randall will reject the contract.

Next season, Randall has a non guaranteed contract worth $19.8 million, which will be the last year of his current contract. Randall will become an unrestricted free agent in 2022, when he can sign a five-year top salary contract that reaches 30% of the team's salary cap. The Knicks also won the off-season Randall Bird rights in 2022.

According to reports, the Knicks are keen to keep Randall, saying that Randall's ability to deal with "adversity" while playing in New York has left a deep impression on the team. According to Ian Begley, members of the Knicks have stressed that they will reserve salary space for 2022 in order to renew Randall's contract. Ian Begley added that the Knicks had been trying to find a suitable contract for both sides last season.

Under the guidance of thibodou, Randall's performance this season has made great progress. He has almost assumed all the responsibilities of the Knicks in the offensive end. Randall ranked first in the league in 2667 minutes in the regular season. His defensive victory contribution, defensive rebounds, total scores and sports goals all ranked in the top 10 of the league, averaging 24.1 points, 10.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists. With a number of data to lead the team's amazing performance, Randall was selected as an all star for the first time in his career, and led the team back to the playoffs after eight years. In the end, Randall was the fastest-growing player of the season. But in the playoffs, Randall's performance did not meet people's expectations. In the series against the Hawks, Randall averaged only 18.0 points per game, with a shooting percentage of 29.8% and a three-point shooting percentage of 33.3%.
