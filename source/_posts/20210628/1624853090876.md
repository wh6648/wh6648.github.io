On June 28, American basketball reporter Evan Messi reported that the heat are actively touting Taylor Hiro, a young outside player in the team.

Another cable reported that Hiro's next home is likely to be the Houston Rockets. And the heat are very interested in the Rockets' two strength veterans John wall and Eric Gordon, hoping that this kind of instant combat power can help the team return to the championship group.

In the rookie season, Taylor Hiro's performance was brilliant enough. In the regular season, he averaged 13.5 points per game, with a three-point shooting rate of 39%. In the playoffs, he became the hero of the heat in the finals. In a total of 21 games, he scored double for 20 times and wrote a record. In the fourth game of the Eastern Conference finals, he also scored 37 amazing points.

However, entering the second season of his career, Hiro quickly encountered a bottleneck. In the regular season, he scored 15.1 points, but his three-point shooting rate dropped to 36%. In the playoffs, the coaching staff lost their trust in him, and Hiro averaged only 9.3 points in four games.

As a result, at the end of the season, rumors about Hiro to be touted by the heat began to appear. According to the latest situation, the 21-year-old's next family is likely to be the eager Houston Rockets.

Ironically, as early as the beginning of this season, the Rockets showed a strong interest in Hiro. When harden proposed to trade and leave the team, one of the first teams the Rockets contacted was the heat.

But at that time, the heat also attached great importance to the value of Hiro, did not want to put it in the deal package, and the negotiation between the two sides broke down.

Now, new rumors appear, and the heat hope to get or wall and Gordon two veteran, this more or less makes some people puzzled.
