On June 28, according to sports illustrated, Cleveland Cavaliers hesitated to renew their contract with Colin sexton.

Once the Cavaliers do not want to give Sexton the promise of a new contract, then, this off-season, they will explore the possibility of trading the tough guard.

Sexton is only 22 years old. In the third season of his career, he has averaged 24.3 points, 3.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game, becoming the core scorer of the Cavaliers. His dual core match with another backcourt Darius garland seems to have gradually become the tactical cornerstone of the team.

According to the labor agreement, Sexton is qualified to renew his contract in advance during the off-season. He can sign a five-year contract worth 168 million US dollars at most.

Sexton plays very hard and hard, and his professionalism is beyond reproach. In addition, his progress in the Cavaliers in the past three years is obvious to all. But the problem is that although Sexton is a high-energy scorer, his style is somewhat "unique". His ability to drive his teammates is not enough, and his scoring efficiency is also limited. Some analysts once believed that the reason why he has good data is that he has enough shooting power in the Cavaliers, and whether such a player is worth a top salary contract is still open to question.

It is with this doubt that the Cavaliers will explore the possibility of trading sexton. Coincidentally, not long ago, the Cavaliers won the draft this year. Considering that there are many talented defenders in the 2021 players, it is not impossible for the Cavaliers to choose a new backcourt player to replace sexton.
