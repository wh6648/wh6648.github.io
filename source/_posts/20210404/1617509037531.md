Boston Celtic legend Paul Pierce obviously enjoyed his holiday. In instagram live broadcast on Friday local time, the former Celtic veteran brought several strippers home, which also made pierce a hot search.

Pierce showed off his mansion on instagram live. Drunk, he smoked cigars leisurely and enjoyed the shoulder and neck massage of strippers. However, the video shows that pierce is not alone in the room, because he also plays cards, smokes and drinks with some friends. During the live broadcast, many fans reminded Pierce in the comment area that he was a married man, with a wife and children.

Pierce's move has undoubtedly caused huge repercussions on social media, and even Laker star Kyle Kuzma has updated his personal twitter to respond.

"Pierce is a bit of a pervert!" quipped Kuzma.

"Forgetting is sharing it with your closest friends," Bradley bill wrote. Bill said pierce should share the video with his closest friends and show his photos and videos in private, or only to specific people.

Pierce has been active in public since his retirement. Now he is a basketball commentator on ESPN's "the jump" and "NBA countdown". It remains to be seen whether he will be punished by the company for his untimely behavior on social media.

Obviously, it's going to be interesting to see what pierce will say next time he appears on ESPN's "the jump" and "NBA countdown.".
