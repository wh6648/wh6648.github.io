April 4 news, according to the famous gossip media TMZ reported that the Los Angeles Lakers Anthony Davis security involved in a car accident, Davis quickly rushed to the scene to see if they can help, and to deal with the accident with the law enforcement officers for a short conversation.

The Laker superstar also became the focus of a motorcycle crash today. Law enforcement officials revealed that the accident led to one person being taken to hospital, and the motorcycle causing the accident was eventually towed away by a trailer.

Davis was not reported to be involved in the accident, but his security guard was hit. Davis quickly arrived at the scene after learning that, when Davis was nearby. According to the video and photos at the scene, Davis was wearing flip flops, casual clothes and masks. He wanted to see if he could help and communicate with the police at the scene. In addition, Davis's team immediately came to the scene, after a conversation, Davis left.

A witness revealed that Davis looked very angry at that time, and he had been communicating with the staff dealing with the accident. This reminds us of Kobe Bryant. In 2019, Kobe witnessed a traffic accident in California. Although he had nothing to do with the accident, he did not choose to leave the scene. Instead, he took the initiative to get out of the car to direct the traffic and appease the people involved in the accident. In September 2018, Kobe also encountered a car accident on the road, and he also got off to help. U.S. media reported that O'Neill also got off the bus many times in the past few years to help coordinate traffic. It seems that the Laker players are very similar at this point.
