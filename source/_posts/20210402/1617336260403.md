On April 2, the NBA officially announced that Nate McMillan of the hawks and Monty Williams of the Suns were elected the best coaches in March.

McMillan was appointed temporary manager of the eagles on March 1 local time. He led the team to an 8-game winning start in March, becoming the first manager to take over the team midway through the 2003-04 season and win the first 8 games. The 8-win streak is also the longest eagles have won since the 14-15 season.

This is the seventh time in Macmillan's coaching career that Macmillan won the best of the month, and he also became the eighth Eagles manager to win the best of the month. In March, the eagles were 9-4.

Williams led the Suns to 11-3 in March, equalling the best record of the West in March. It was the second time Williams had won the best of the month in his coaching career, the first time in January 2011 when he was the Hornets coach.

Williams became the first suns coach to win the best coach of the month since December 2013, and the seventh suns coach to win the award.

It is worth mentioning that in March, the best coach of East and West worked together in Portland from 2005 to 2010, when McMillan was the coach of the Blazers and Williams was the assistant.
