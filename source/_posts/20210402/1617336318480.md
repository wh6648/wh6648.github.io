It was reported on April 2 that the nets easily beat the Hornets 111-89 at home, winning four games in a row and leading the Eastern Division. According to statistics, the nets have won 20 of the last 23 games, the first time in the history of the team.

New aid Aldrich today ushered in the nets to join the team's first show, and the identity of the starting center. In the whole game, Aldrich contributed 11 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 steals and 1 block. After the game, Aldrich was also interviewed by the media for the first time.

"I enjoy myself, it's very easy for me, so I must have a good time tonight," Aldrich told Chris Webber. "I can get on the court and play. I'm just myself. I've been in good shape and working hard instead of just sitting on the couch. "

"It's like tonight, they said," just do your own thing when you're on the court. "If you're free, you'll do it. Now I'm more confident, Carey (Owen) and those guys, let me get a chance to shoot easily, I'm looking forward to being myself Aldrich continued, "everyone is like family to me. They are always friendly. When I first shot, everyone cheered for me."

Aldrich's excellent performance also won the praise of manager Nash and other teammates. "We think we need to give him (Aldrich) a chance to adapt, so why not let him start directly? See if he can find the rhythm? He is a very intelligent defender. He understands the space and concepts on the field. No matter what situation he is in, he knows what is in front of him and what he is looking for. I'm proud of his performance tonight Nash said.

At the same time, Nash also said that Jordan should be ready at any time, because the next game will let him start. "I don't want to let him (little Jordan) play at the end of the game. He's a veteran and he has a great spirit off the bench." Nash said.

"What surprised me most about Aldrich was his calmness and his role as a big man. I think he missed the back slap Owen said of Aldrich after the game.

When talking about the prospect of the team winning the championship this season, Owen said that it is the most important to avoid injuries in a long season. "I don't take it for granted. We need to see the integration of the team. At this point, we are the most flexible and successful team in the League. We can play any team, put anyone on the court and show our depth Said Owen.

In addition, the Hornets player Malik Munk sprained his ankle in the game and was helped back to the dressing room by his teammates. After the game, Hornets coach Borrego also talked about Munch's injury: "I feel sorry for this kid. He has been fighting all the time. This season he has brought us great inspiration. I hope it won't be too serious. We will get more information tonight or tomorrow."
