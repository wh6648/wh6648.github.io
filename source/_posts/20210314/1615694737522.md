On March 13, NBA reporter Ramona Sherbourne reported that informed sources revealed that MRI results showed that the 76ers star Joel enbid's left knee had no structural damage, just bone bruises, and that the "emperor"'s cruciate ligament and meniscus were all right.

According to the source, there is no specific return schedule for nbid, who may be absent for two weeks due to bone bruises. As the current situation of the 76ers is not so bad, so enbid is not in a big way to let the whole team up and down a sigh of relief.

Samas chalaniya, a well-known reporter of the Olympic, followed up and got the tip that nbid is expected to be absent for 2-3 weeks.

Today, the 76ers beat the Wizards in the third quarter. After finishing a dunk, nbid fell to the ground in pain. Then he got up and limped back to the dressing room. At that time, the 76ers official said that nbid was diagnosed with excessive extension of his left knee. Before the injury, nbid had 23 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 blocks.

Enbid was asked about his injury at the press conference after the game. 76ers coach Doug rivers revealed that enbid was in a very good mood. Now the emperor's injury is not serious, which is definitely good news for Philadelphia.

Enbid is seen as a favorite for MVP and defensive player of the year. So far this season, he has averaged 29.9 points, 11.5 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.4 blocks.
