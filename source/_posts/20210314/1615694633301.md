On March 14, the Nets beat the pistons 100-95 at home. James Harden made 8-for-19 shots, 6-for-0 three-point shots, 24 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 2 steals and 3 blocks. It was harden's ninth triple double in the regular season and his 55th triple double in his career.

After the All-Star weekend, harden didn't perform strongly in the personal offensive end. Today, against the pistons, harden's offensive efficiency was not high, especially outside the three-point line. In the first half, he made 3-for-0 three-point shots, but he made a lot of contributions in other aspects. He used all kinds of possible offensive ways to help the team gain points. Under his instigation, the attack of the rebound net was like a kaleidoscope, Harden and Owen are also very satisfied with the team's performance as a whole. After their tacit cooperation, they laughed and celebrated.

Of course, the most wonderful thing is the legend of harden, who has completed several basket blowing performances with little Jordan. With 43 seconds left in the second quarter, harden held the ball at the top of the right arc and dribbled the ball continuously, then suddenly passed the ball to little Jordan on the bottom line. However, little Jordan didn't attack directly, but hit the ground to pass the ball back to harden. After harden received the ball, he threw the ball high into the air against Plumley, who was on the front guard. Little Jordan would take off high and finish the double hand slam dunk. All the men and women on the net bench stood up to applaud for their wonderful cooperation.

After entering the second half of the game, harden continued to be the green leaf of his teammates. This time he benefited from Harris. In a short period of 34 seconds, harden not only sent two assists to Harris, but also contributed a wonderful block. When the team needs stars to stand up, harden will not shrink back and help the nets expand their advantage.

In the key fourth quarter of the game, harden continued to deliver shells for little Jordan. After harden reached the basket with the ball, he passed the ball without looking at others. Little Jordan also won the hope after receiving the autumn, and easily buckled the ball into the net. Two minutes and eight seconds, harden made a forced shot to defend the three men under the basket and won the free throw chance. After two free throws, he helped the nets regain the lead. After the restart of the game, harden made two consecutive difficult attacks and stopped the pistons. In 19.1 seconds, harden made another classic little throw. In 13.4 seconds, harden once again stood on the free throw line and hit 2 free throws, which helped the nets expand their advantage to 5 points. With Ellington missing 3 points, the nets struggled to win the game.
