March 14 news, Brooklyn basketball nets coach Steve Nash today after training in an interview about the team's injuries.

When talking about Kevin Durant's recovery process, Nash said that Durant's hamstring injury will undergo a medical image review this week, but it is not clear when it will be carried out, and the official report will be released after the test results are released. It is worth mentioning that Dr. rajpal Brar, a professional physiotherapist who paid close attention to NBA, analyzed and believed that Durant should have suffered a level 2 hamstring tear, which took up to 6-8 weeks to recover.

Speaking of Blake Griffin's comeback plan, Nash said that although Griffin's condition will continue to improve, he may still be absent for 1-2 weeks. The team is very cautious about this and is not in a hurry for Griffin's comeback. Before joining the nets, Griffin played for the clippers and pistons. Griffin also said publicly that the reason for choosing the nets is to win the championship.

Spencer - Ding Weidi is recovering from injury in Los Angeles, Nash said he has not contacted Ding Weidi for several weeks, is not clear about the specific situation, he does not want to speculate whether Ding Weidi will return this season, he only focuses on Ding Weidi's health.

After signing Griffin, the nets still have two places left. The most important thing is that the nets now have a special injury case of $5.7 million and a special tax case of $5.4 million. They can use these to attract their favorite players. Nash was asked about the recruitment in an interview and he stressed again that he and the coaching staff are very satisfied with the current squad.

"I don't want to take out my Christmas wish list. We have a great team, a deep team and a lot of people I really like working with. I have to leave it to max (general manager of basketball), I think it's the management's business Nash said.
