On April 9, it was reported that Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen curry recently missed the second back-to-back game due to a contusion of the caudal vertebra. However, according to Anthony Slater of the Olympic, curry will play two back-to-back games tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

It is worth mentioning that, last time back-to-back, curry didn't play in the second back-to-back game because of the injury of the tailbone. The warriors will play the Wizards at home on April 10 and the rockets on April 11. According to reports, curry will play two back-to-back games.

"The plan is for Stephen curry to play in the upcoming back-to-back game between the wizards and the Rockets." Anthony Slater reports.

In addition, Anthony Slater said that warriors coach Cole made it clear that curry's playing time is about 34-35 minutes per night. "When asked about Curry's playing time, Steve Cole still insisted that they would keep Curry's playing time at about 34-35 minutes instead of chasing victory (overusing curry) Anthony Slater said.

It will be interesting to focus on how curry can play his part in the game with limited playing time. Obviously, the warriors need to win more than ever. In addition, when talking about Curry's shooting, Cole said: "now we need to be clear about one thing, never interfere with Curry's shooting choice and the number of shots. This is also the main content of our dialogue. No matter what his past shooting choices are, he should continue and expand this level. All his shots are the best choice
