On April 9, Brooklyn basketball superstar James Harden posted an inspiring picture on his personal social media today, saying the team has "a bright future".

James Harden's trade has made the nets a new super team. A team with harden, Kevin Durant, Carey Owen, LaMarcus Aldrich, Blake Griffin and Jordan Jr. is just book strength. The nets are enough to scare off many teams. I'm afraid no one in the management of the other 29 teams in the league would not envy the star shining of the nets.

Obviously, such a team is likely to dominate in the next few years. Although they haven't won the championship yet, their big three are still in their prime years. Even if they join the nets after being cut off, Griffin and Aldrich are the players above the league average. Harden has also realized the potential of this team. Today, harden posted a picture of a teammate of the Brooklyn basketball and nets team, saying that the team has "a bright future.".

"I told my brothers that if we play well, the sky is the limit." James wrote in an accompanying article.

Harden is a perfect match for the Brooklyn nets on the court, and he seems to be a good leader. So far this season, harden has played 34 games for the nets, averaging 25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds and 11 assists. However, harden was injured in the game with the Knicks before. After MRI examination, the result showed that harden suffered a right hamstring strain, and he will be absent for at least 10 days.
