For the Lakers, the best news is that within a month, all members will return. Before that, Chuang Shen is still the biggest bright spot of the team. Everyone cares about his compatibility with the team. On April 9, 2021, the heat beat the Lakers 110-104, with Zhuang Shen scoring 15 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals, while pop set a new high of 28 points this season.

Zhuang Shen + thick eyebrow is bound to become the top interior combination in history. Zhuang Shen still played very freely in the face of the defensive heat. Even if he ate a cap from Adebayor in the middle of the first quarter, his overall performance was excellent. Whether it's the hook hit in the first step of the back in the interior, or the second attack, one person grabs three people from the heat's small team. This is the effect brought by Zhuang Shen. His arrival may also liberate the pressure of thick eyebrow in the interior, which will be the real killing move of the Lakers in the championship this year.

In the middle of the first quarter, Zhuang Shen even steals in the backcourt, and then pushes forward one by one, assists his teammates to lay up. A team has two top interior lines with this ability. Now the monopoly ability of top teams can be seen. The Lakers got off to a bad start, and Zhuang Shen led the team back one ball at a time. Four minutes in the first quarter, Chuang Shen was caught in the trap again. As a result, he was able to survive in the crack. A wonderful pass was inserted and the layup was made to catch up with the heat.

However, before the end of the first quarter, Zhuang Shen went back to the dressing room again, and the Lakers fell into passivity again. In fact, in addition to Zhuang Shen, the outside line of the Laker team gave a response. Pop and Matthews even got 19 points and hit four three-point shots in more than a quarter. In the middle of the second quarter, after the team was pulled apart by pop, Morris also kept hitting the inside line after a three-point hemostasis. In the third minute of the second quarter, Popper even staged a dream dance step, hitting the board with high difficulty.

After Zhuang Shen's return, he was able to eat well in the interior. Facing the heat's small team, Zhuang Shen's height is really superior. In the middle of the third quarter, the heat opened the difference again. As a result, Caruso came out and hit the three-point saving shot, pop also hit the three-point saving shot, and the Lakers narrowed the difference to two points again. Facing one of the best defensive teams in the league, the Laker team still frequently gave key three points to stop the decline. A few minutes later, the heat hit a climax, or pop a stop jump shot, a counterattack layup, once again narrowed the difference, Pop has now hit 22 points.

At the end of the game, it was Popper who saved the Lakers. For a time, the heat led to 8 points, but Popper made another consecutive shot. After winning 25 points, Popper also set a new high of this season, which was 23 points before. Although the Lakers lost the game in the end, Zhuang Shen played his best performance after joining the team, while pop set a new record. The Lakers lost in the last five minutes and finally lost to the heat.
