April 19 news, reports from the U.S. media said that Kevin Durant in today's basketball nets lost the heat in the game injury retreat. KD returned to the dressing room after 4:03 in the first quarter because of thigh discomfort. Then the nets officially announced that Durant suffered thigh contusion and would not return to the game.

TV slow motion shows that KD was injured in an offensive breakthrough with the ball. Before the injury, KD's performance was remarkable. He hit all three shots, including 2-for-2 three-point shots, 8 points, 1 rebound and 1 block.

Now the biggest question is, is KD's thigh contusion serious? At the press conference after the game, Nets coach Steve Nash talked about KD's injury. "Kevin (Durant) is in pain and at the moment I don't know how serious his contusion is," Nash said. "He will be evaluated tomorrow morning (local time). ¡±

"After seeing how he feels tomorrow morning, the team will decide whether it is necessary to scan his injured thigh," Nash continued.

The nets are on three consecutive road trips. After losing to the heat today, the nets will go to pelicans and raptors. "The current plan is for KD to go on the road with the team," Nash said. "I'll talk about it after full communication with the medical team."

From Nash's interview, there was no excessive concern about KD's thigh contusion. It is worth mentioning that Durant just returned on April 8 local time, and was absent for nearly two months because of his right hamstring injury.
