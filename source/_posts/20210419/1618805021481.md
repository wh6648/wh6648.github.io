Nets coach Steve Nash told reporters on the sidelines: "obviously, when Kevin (Durant) can't play, we miss him very much. In the face of injuries this season, we have to put forward different starting and tactics, which is not very good for our running in. ¡±

KD has suffered many injuries this season. He just came back on April 8 local time. He was absent for nearly two months because of the injury to his right hamstring.
