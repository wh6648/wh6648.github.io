April 19 news, ESPN well-known reporter Adrian wojnarowski reported that the NBA has told the teams to be prepared to deal with this week's Minneapolis City on Derek Chauvin kneeling to kill African American George Freud case, including the possibility of delaying the game.

According to sources, the possible protests, civil strife and team reactions after the verdict have made the NBA office prepare to postpone the game for one or two nights this week.

It is expected that there will be a closing debate on the Derek Shawan case on Monday local time. Xiao Wan, a former police officer in Minneapolis, put his knee on Freud's neck for more than nine minutes in May 2020, which eventually led to Freud's death. Xiao Wan faced charges of second degree murder, third degree murder and second degree manslaughter, but he refused to plead guilty to these charges.

It is worth mentioning that last week, because police shot and killed an unarmed black dot Wright in the Brooklyn central parking lot in the suburb of Minneapolis, the game between the Timberwolves and the nets was delayed.

In addition, in August 2020, when the NBA played in Orlando Disney, another black man, Jacob Black, was shot by police in noza, Wisconsin. After that, the NBA postponed the playoffs. It is worth mentioning that the Milwaukee Bucks took the lead in the strike, resulting in a three-day break in the league game.
