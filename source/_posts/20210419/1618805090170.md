Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant has been away for more than a year, but he still lives in the memory of people who love him, especially his wife Vanessa. Today is the 20th anniversary of Kobe's and Vanessa's marriage. Vanessa sent a warm message on instagram, her personal social media.

"Happy anniversary, baby. I love you, 20 years. @"Kobe," Vanessa wrote.

Vanessa uploaded a video of her and Kobe kissing on their wedding day in personal social media. It is worth mentioning that in another post, Vanessa expressed her love for Kobe in a video. "I love you now and always and always@ "Kobe," Vanessa wrote.

Kobe has left, but Vanessa's love for him remains the same as it was 20 years ago when they got married. Around 4 a.m. on January 27, 2020, Kobe died of a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, killing all nine people on board, including his second daughter, Jaina. Although it's hard to imagine the pain of losing them, Vanessa said that both Kobe and Gianna inspired her to move on, to work harder and to do better every day.
