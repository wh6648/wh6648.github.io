On April 19, James Harden continued to stop injured. Kevin Durant only played 4 minutes and 03 seconds in the first quarter and returned to the dressing room due to thigh contusion. Carey Owen, who led the team alone, didn't help the nets to retreat in Miami. The defeat was a bit of a pity because Owen missed several chances at the end of the game.

The whole game, Owen played 37 minutes 35 seconds, 19 shots only 6, of which 3-point 9-for-2, hand over 20 points 4 rebounds 9 assists 2 steals 2 blocks of data. He made four mistakes on the field, positive and negative - 8, both of which were the worst in the team.

Everyone knows the competitiveness of the big three of the nets. But when Owen led the team alone, his overall performance was not satisfactory. Owen's last score on the court was 3:31 before the end of the game, when he caused Andre igodara's defensive fouls and made two free throws to help the nets lead 107-101. But after that, the nets team with 6-point advantage was hit by the heat with a wave of 8-0 attack wave and took the game away directly!

In the last two minutes of the game, Owen contributed the last three shots of the nets. The three shots, Owen all choose long-range, including two three-point. It's a pity that all the three shots are iron. In fact, at that time, the heat had focused their defensive attention on Owen. At this time, if Owen chooses to break through with the ball, or use pick and roll to pass to his teammates, is this a better choice? From the game, we can see that Owen's choice of the last three shots is open to question.

Of course, the last moment is the personal ability of the star. Today, only Owen has the ability in the basketball team. Therefore, Owen can only blame himself for his defeat

The net team was very disappointed to be killed. Owen's recent three games, the nets only 1-2, two lost to the 76ers and heat, which is the nets in the east of the main competitors.
