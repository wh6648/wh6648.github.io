The Phoenix Suns eliminated the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference finals and advanced to the finals for the third time in the team's history (the first time was led by Westfall in 1976, and the second time was led by Buckley in 1993, but they did not win the championship). It has been 28 years since the last time. At the beginning of the 21st century, under the leadership of Nash, the sun once enjoyed great scenery in the west, but failed to reach the finals (hereinafter referred to as Nash sun); On the contrary, Paul joined the Suns at the end of the season (hereinafter referred to as Paul suns) and created a miracle. Why?

The two suns of different periods have the same short board - the owner Robert Sawyer is a famous Iron Rooster, stingy, in order to save money, he will sell or not renew some practical players: for example, in the summer of 2005, he sent off Joe Johnson (later became the eagles boss), in the summer of 2007, he sent off Kurt Thomas, who defends Duncan very well, The 2019 season saw off Warren (who later became the Pacers' top scorer). On the other hand, he is eager for quick success and instant benefits, and wants to make short-term investment to compete for the championship. For example, in 2008, he changed his lineup, removed MSN portfolio (NASH, young Stoudemire and Marion), sent Marion away, gambled O'Neill, and lost in a mess. This kind of schizophrenia is harmful to the sun. Fortunately, general manager James Jones has a brilliant hand and gambles Paul.

The two suns have the same long board: the team's medical team is known as the "great doctor" and "great doctor". Thomas Carter, the chief team doctor, is a well-known orthopedic surgeon in the United States (there used to be the chief sports trainer Aron Nelson, but he has changed to Pelican). He has cured Nash, Stuart and Carter, and extended his career, It also makes Shaquille O'Neill and "old patient" Grant Hill glow in the second spring.

This season, due to the short off-season, tight schedule, more injuries in the league, and injuries to many team stars, Paul Suns' opponents in three rounds all injured the main players (the Lakers injured their eyebrows, the Nuggets injured Murray, and the Clippers injured Leonard). The Suns are the healthiest team in the league, escorted by Taiyi, which is an important factor for them to advance to the finals.

Friends can not help but ask: the sun team doctor is not only now, why Nash sun injury? This is related to coach d'antony at that time. Although he was a pioneer in the era of small ball, he had fatal defects. He often used eight players in short rotation, overdrawn the health of the players, and the Suns were full of injured players, so that the Suns doctors could not save him and "couldn't make ends meet" (NASH, as a patient with congenital spinal advancement, has been difficult to persist for many years with the help of Taiyi). In the 2010 season, Quintet has been better protected, but it's a comeback. Now sun coach Monty attaches great importance to the protection of players, regular season with long rotation, pay attention to the control of Booker, Paul and Aton's playing time; Although the playoffs with short rotation, but Paul in the first round after the shoulder injury, Monty cut his playing time by Penn to make up for protection.

Let's talk about the configuration of the two suns: Nash and Paul are both historical point guards with top passing vision and good scoring ability. They are good at playing small and big roll call inside players and can score big points; Nash's weak body and poor defense can only make offensive fouls; Paul is good at suppressing the opponent's defense, supplemented by small moves, is a first-class defender.

Xiao Si's body is strong, has the epic level face frame attack ability, has the good middle shot, in 2005 playoffs faced the Spurs once to slash fiercely, the field average 37 points, but only can block the hat, the defensive consciousness is poor; Eaton doesn't have the explosive power to score, but he can also take the cake, and he can shoot in the middle when necessary. His defense ability is not possessed by him.

Paul sun has such a super scorer as Booker, and is also a good holding point. Nash sun does not have such a scarce resource, which is also the factor of solar energy's promotion to the final decision. In addition, Penn's substitute holding player is also very precious. Nash suns has been looking for scorers and ball players since Joe Johnson left. They have tried Shaquille O'Neal, Grant Hill, Vincente and Reid, but the effect is not good. Nash's substitute babosa, Brazil lightning, has strong impact, but the organization ability is low, and the playoffs are declining, which can't share Nash's worries. It was only in the 2010 season that coach Dietrich jintari developed Dragic as the No.2 player and substitute for Nash that the Suns were able to shine, but it was just a flash in the pan.

The suns in NASH and Paul's time played pick and roll on the offensive end, with top point guards (NASH and Paul) and top pie eaters (Sven and ayton). However, there are obvious differences between the two teams in attack and defense. Nash Suns play small ball fast break, Nash and smalls pick and roll attack, Marion, Quentin, Tim Thomas and rajabel open space, players v-position play seven seconds attack, play a wave of solar storm attack frenzy, this attack system restrain weak positional teams, such as Yao Ming and McGrady's rockets. But he's hard to beat the Spurs.

Spurs learn from the European style, and build a rich offensive and defensive system, such as double tower attack, inside out attack, pick and roll attack, break zone attack, regional joint defense and mixed defense, everything (from 2012 onwards to speed up the dynamic attack). Against the Suns, the Spurs can slow down and destroy the rhythm of the suns. If necessary, they dare to speed up and compete with the Suns for firepower, long rotation and short rotation, GDP three ball holding points against the Suns' single core, top defense against the Suns' weak defense, popovic's platoon arrangement and on-the-spot command over d'antony. The Spurs have eliminated Nash suns three times in the playoffs, which is the biggest obstacle for the suns.

In order to beat the Spurs, Nash suns gambled a lot in 2008 to send Marion away, and introduced O'Neal to fight against the Spurs. Unexpectedly, O'Neal was not compatible with the small ball playing method. In 2008, he was eliminated by the Spurs in the first round, and in 2009, he couldn't even enter the playoffs (when the coach changed to Terry Porter). In 2010, Kingsley took over as head coach, regained the small ball, and developed Dragic as a substitute holding point. Finally, he eliminated the Spurs in the playoffs, advanced to the Western Conference, and finally lost the championship team of that year. But the Suns are at the end of the game. Shawn left. The introduction of gotat, Warwick, Vince Carter, Brooks and chadrives has no effect. Nash entered the health care mode, and then went to the F4 of the Laker team.

While Paul's sun is mainly in positional warfare, Monty makes the sun slow down to adapt to Paul's rhythm, and sets up the ball free running position and strong and weak side cooperation to create the opportunity for teammates to shoot at fixed points and play space basketball. The team has accumulated a lot of three breakups (Penn, Cameron Johnson, bridges and Claude) and has a good depth of lineup. The Suns attack relies on Paul's (or Booker's) pick and roll to drive his teammates to make fixed-point jump shots. The attack range is from the central shooting area to the three-point line. Compared with small ball attack, positional attack can observe the situation more calmly and ensure the success rate of attack. Booker's bloodthirsty scoring ability is the foundation of the suns. Aton is upgraded to a strong center in the playoffs and no longer has the tendency to fight clean. Paul's steady key scoring ensures the victory. All these help the sun to pass.

The defensive end of Nash suns is not as good as Paul suns. Nash and small Si defense is poor, team defense task falls on team mate Marion, rajibel and Kurt Thomas and so on, double core double leakage doomed the Suns can only rely on enthusiasm to make up for defense, it is difficult to build a defensive system. In 2007, the Suns were the most defensive year. In the playoffs, the Spurs and the Suns shared equally. In other years, they were average.

Paul Suns have solid defense, Paul and Aton as the core of the team have good defensive ability; Bridges has grown into a first-class 3D player of single defense and cooperative defense; Claude brings defensive hardness to the team. The Suns often use defense change to ensure the continuity of defense and in place rate; Sometimes they use joint defense, especially when Saric and Kaminsky are the centers, to cover up their defects. Strong defense is the reason why Paul suns stand out.

Of course, we can't just judge the hero by success or failure. This season's Suns' three round opponents have all lost the main player, which is closely related to the tight and abnormal schedule, and has the element of luck. But Nash sun is facing the Spurs Dynasty seal, in 2010 when the light returned, encountered the Laker small Dynasty, the opponent was too strong. In fact, Nash Suns have Championship strength. If the Suns don't have Holly's fall in 2007, is it possible for them to beat the Spurs? And after the Spurs, it's almost a championship (it's not disrespect for the jazz and Cavaliers).
