July 2 news, from "the ring" reporter Kevin O'Connor reported that informed sources revealed that the lone Rangers and heat plan to vigorously promote the introduction of Coway Leonard.

On Thursday, the Clippers lost to the suns in the G6 Western Conference finals, leaving the finals 2-4, ending the 20-21 season. Leonard has been out since suffering a knee injury in the Western Conference semi-final G4. Leonard's current contract will expire in the summer of 2022, but he has player options this summer to choose to jump out of the contract and test the free market.

Sources say that if Leonard tries the free market, he will have a string of suitors. In addition to the lone Rangers and the heat, the Knicks will pursue any possible superstar.

Because of Luca donchic's existence and management's ability to create top salary space, the lone ranger team is considered by some executives to be the most threatening team to get Leonard besides the fast fleet. In the years when Leonard worked with a sports brand, he established a good relationship with Nick Harrison, an executive who recently became the general manager of the lone Rangers.

As for the heat, Leonard and Paul George had been recruiting Jimmy Butler to the Clippers before they joined hands, but they failed in the end.

But O'Connor admits there are still signs that Leonard may stay with the Clippers. In addition to a $17.1 million mansion he bought in Los Angeles in March, he also has a $6.7 million penthouse near Staples Center. Investing so much money in Los Angeles real estate, at least acknowledging the possibility that Leonard plans to stay with the Clippers.
