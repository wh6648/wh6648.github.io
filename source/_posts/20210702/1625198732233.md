On July 2, according to a podcast by Zach Lowe, a famous journalist, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Clippers are interested in kenba Walker and are trying to get him.

"I think both teams in Los Angeles will be looking at kenba walker Zach Lowe said.

Celtic and thunder have officially completed the deal, they sent away kenba walker, the first round draft in 2021 and the second round in 2025, in exchange for Al hofford, Moses brown and the second round in 2023. However, according to Kristian Winfield, a league source said that Walker is close to being traded again, but it is not clear whether the deal will happen before or after the start of the season.

It is worth mentioning that the general manager of the Lakers palinka on Walker's deal to the thunder inquiry, put forward a Kyle - Kuzma as the main trading scheme. This season is undoubtedly bitter for the Lakers. Their dream of defending the title was shattered in the first round of the playoffs. There is no doubt that the purple gold army will adjust the lineup in this off-season. Walker also expressed his willingness to play with James and Anthony Davis in an interview. In addition, the clippers have just finished their season tour. If they can get walker, it means that the Clippers will become a team with better competitive strength.

Under the influence of Walker's injury this season, he only played 43 games in the regular season, averaging 19.3 points, 4 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 42% shooting percentage; He played three games with injuries in the playoffs, averaging 12.7 points per game and 31.7% shooting.
