It was reported on July 2 that the Suns beat the Clippers 4-2 with a big score and returned to the finals after 28 years. This is also the first time that the Suns star Devon Booker has reached the finals in his career.

Talking about the team's return to the finals after 28 years, Booker said: "it's a long way to go. That's what I said to our equipment manager, Jay Gaspar, who has been with the Suns since 1988. He's the only one on this team who's been longer than me. We have been waiting for this moment for many years. Monty (coach Williams) came here and built a team culture, he led us to meet new opportunities. Right now, we have it. We have work to do, but it's great. "

Booker also talked about his relationship with Paul. He said he knew Paul as early as in the draft¡° He (Paul) took me to train with D'Angelo Russell and Carl Anthony downs. He trained with us a few times and that's how we initially established our relationship. But I think he thought I'd have a lot of respect for him, but I'm throwing rubbish at him. Several times we almost had a fight because we would have differences on the court. I don't like to play against players like that, but I like to have them on my team. Jay Claude was one of them, and I had an argument with him. But it's the people I'm going to fight with, and I'm willing to be teammates with. Because I know when I'm in trouble, they will support me, give me confidence and let me move on. "

Coach Monty Williams and Chris Paul have maintained a very close relationship throughout the season, Booker said it is very good for the team¡° I think that's the most important part. We all want to see each other succeed and the team succeed. Therefore, when people agree, this kind of relationship will happen naturally. We often get together and watch games together. It just happens over time, experiencing with each other, spending real quality time together, having high-quality communication, not only about basketball, but also about life. This is how to develop the relationship that we have established and will continue to establish. It's our first year together, so I'm very grateful to him Booker said.

It was Paul's first time in 16 years to reach the finals. There is no doubt that Paul will be a member of the hall of fame in the future. What does this year's experience mean for Paul's career and achievements? "To get to the finals for the first time in his career, I know he's very happy," Booker said. I know what he's after, we have the same understanding, we don't talk about it often, but we know what we want to achieve. He's one of the best point guards ever, that's the truth. Everyone knows that it's the best. He has paid for it for 16 years. I'm 24 years old, which means he was in the League when I was 8. I remember when I was very young, I used to go to New Orleans to watch Paul play and watch him play there. I played in Paul's shoes all through high school, so Paul's mark will always be imprinted in my basketball career

"I don't think we're over the hump. We have bigger plans. But as I said, since he (Paul) entered the NBA, I've been watching games, and I've always been his fan. It's crazy. As his fan, now I can fight with him, life is a cycle, but I am very lucky, very lucky to be in this position Booker said.
