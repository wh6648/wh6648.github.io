On July 2, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. The Milwaukee Bucks are in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals with the Atlanta Hawks, which is the battle of Mount Everest. At the end of the game, the Bucks beat the Hawks 123-112, leading 3-2 in the series.

In the last game, some of the Eastern Conference finals, which were originally one-sided, turned out to be variable again.

After 7 minutes and 16 seconds in the third quarter, the letter brother sprained his leg in a big angle when defending Capella, and then retired. And because of the end of the letter brother, Bucks team completely flustered, Eagle took the opportunity to set off a climax, successfully take away the victory.

When the series return to the balance of 2-2, the game suddenly a lot of questions, will the letter come on? What's the extent of his knee injury? Once the letter brother is sure not to fight, what should the buck do?

And the Hawks side, Trey - Yang can take the opportunity to come back? Did the eagles have the best chance to turn over?

In the battle of Tianwang mountain, some of the questions have been answered. Xingge and Trey Yang have all entered the injury list and are unable to lead the team. At the same time, the two teams lacking the number one core can only make adjustments passively.

But due to the ball, the eagles took the lead to make a change, therefore, for this change, the Bucks have more or less the bottom of the heart. In contrast, Bucks side, Bobbie - Portis replace letter brother into the starting line-up, and quickly reaped the miracle.

In the first quarter, the Bucks shot at the same time, beating their opponents in a daze. During the period, Huo ledi showed his core value, he swept the home team in the first 10 points of 7 points. Then, Portis began to steal the mirror, his second attack success, dunk also into, greatly boosted the morale of the team.

You know, the bucks are one of the best attacking teams in the league. However, they were suppressed by the eagles in the three second zone. Obviously, after reflection, the Bucks completely changed their tactical strategy, they no longer tangled in the three-point shooting rate of the outside line, but took attacking the three second area as the team's core offensive strategy.

Under the guidance of this strategy, the state of big Lopez and Portis was activated early. In the middle of the second quarter, in addition to Tucker, the other four in the Bucks' first round scored in double, and their scores in the three second area were also far ahead.

After Yi Bian, the Bucks resolutely carried out this game, and here, big Lopez became the biggest beneficiary of tactics, he ate bread to support in the interior, scoring as easy as searching for things. You know, in the past two years, in order to cater to the Bucks' system, Daluo has been forced to dare to play the space type inside line, forced to practice hard three-point ball.

But today, Daluo's play, but some back to the nets period, the main traditional Center days. In addition, Bobbie - Portis to replace the letter brother starting, get 22 points, 8 rebounds, 3 assists, also has a surprising play.

Throughout the game, the Bucks scored 66-36 in the interior, fully winning the opponent by 30 points, and the game gradually lost suspense in the Bucks' continuous interior attack.
