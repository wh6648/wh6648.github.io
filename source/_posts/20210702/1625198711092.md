On July 2, it was reported that Damian Lillard, the leading star of Portland Trail Blazers, appeared in Los Angeles to watch the WNBA Los Angeles Sparks' game against Las Vegas ace with the superstar LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers, which caused heated discussion.

James and his team had a very disappointing season. A few months after winning the NBA championship, the Lakers lost to the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs. Most people think that the injuries of James and Anthony Davis are the reason for their early withdrawal from the playoffs. According to previous reports, the Lakers are actively looking for partners for James and Davis.

Since the end of the Trail Blazers' season, the media has revealed that Lillard is dissatisfied with the team and has no intention. There are also media reports that the differences between the pioneer boss, management and lilard are growing. Previously, former NBA champion Channing Frye thought that Lillard might have ulterior motives to represent the U.S. men's basketball team in this year's Olympic Games. He hoped to use this opportunity to recruit players for the Blazers. Recently, an NBA agent revealed that Lillard can follow the example of James Harden before he left the Rockets.
