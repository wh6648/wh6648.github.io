Recently, the U.S. media published articles listing the five teams with the most chips before the closing date of the deal.

Here are the details:

5. Rocket

Since the mid January deal with harden, the Rockets have become the fish belly of the league. Before the All Star Holiday, the Rockets ended up with a wave of 13 consecutive losses. Although the management of the Rockets will never admit it, the reality is that the Rockets are expected to be completely rotten at the end of the season. In this case, most of the Rockets veterans are not in the team's future blueprint. So, recently, from PJ tucker to Eric Gordon, to wall and oradipo, almost half of the players have become bargaining chips in the team's trade negotiations.

4. Knight

In January of this year, in the deal involving harden, the Cavaliers bought a younger interior gate, jarette Allen. Shortly after that, they announced that "Zhuang Shen" Andre Drummond would be put on the shelf. However, in addition to Zhuang Shen, Knight's other insiders also have trading value. From Lefu and McKee to young NANs, there have been constant rumors in the market recently. A basic prediction is that there is a high probability that some of these players will leave before the trade deadline.

3. Thunder

Thunder's reconstruction has started more than a season, but until now, reconstruction has not seen much. At least at this stage, the thunder management is still accumulating chips and waiting for opportunities. In the current roster, most of the players can be put on the shelf except for a few people such as new nuclear Alexander. Now, hofford and George Hill are the most rumored players in the market. At that time, if the thunder could exchange chips conducive to reconstruction, they could not only send away the veterans, but also consider matching the draft right.

76 people

In the first half of the season, the performance of the 76ers was astonishing. Despite the impact of the epidemic, the team has been ranked first in the East, and the double core enbid and Ben Simmons have given the best performance of their career so far. However, with the recent recovery of other strong teams in the East and the strong rise of the nets, the 76ers feel new pressure. In the recent market, Philadelphia has become quite active. In the lineup, Philadelphia also has a lot of chips for trading. If they use them flexibly, they are fully capable of further upgrading the lineup.

1. Warrior
