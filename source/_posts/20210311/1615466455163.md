March 11, earlier today, spurs coach Greg Popovich said in an interview that all star inside LaMarcus Aldrich will not play for the Spurs. For a while, the Spurs will seek a deal for Adelaide.

Subsequently, American media published articles listing four potential subordinates of Adelaide:

1. Celtic

There are many reasons for the green shirt to pursue Adelaide. First of all, in the past few years, the inside has always been the weakness of the green shirt. Especially this season, the newly joined Tristan Thompson is not acclimatized, and the defects of the inside line have been used by opponents for many times. In the past few years when hofford left, the green army's inside line technology is relatively rough, and their initiative is not strong. In contrast, although Adelaide is old, he has excellent projection ability. As a former all star, his technology and experience are also excellent. In addition, during the off-season, the green army won a special deal of US $28.5 million, which became their advantage in trading Adelaide.

2. Pioneers

For the Spurs, it is of course an ideal option to trade Adelaide directly. However, once the Spurs can't find a suitable home and get back the right chips, they will also consider buying out Adelaide's contract with $24 million left in one year. If Adelaide is really bought out, it is undoubtedly the best choice for him to return to his hometown and return to Portland. In fact, in the past two years, there have been rumors that Adelaide wants to return to the pioneers. In reality, after Nur KIC was injured, there is a shortage of inside staff in Poland, and Adelaide's joining should have a saving effect.

3. Lone ranger

Adelaide, 35, has made limited contribution to the defensive end, but in attack, his soft shooting touch and excellent range are still valuable. This kind of offensive firepower is undoubtedly necessary for the lone ranger with a weak interior. In the lone ranger, Adelaide can play as a substitute for portzingis and buy insurance for portzin's unstable state and health. In addition, once to the playoffs, Adelaide's rich experience, will also become a lone ranger's wealth.

4. The Lakers
