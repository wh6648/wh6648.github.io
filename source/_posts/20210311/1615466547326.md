March 11 news, "Forbes" reporter Mike MAZZEO said in an article that James Harden has shown a completely different state after joining the Brooklyn basketball nets. He has also brought leadership and a sense of responsibility to the team.

Kevin Durant has played only 19 games for the blue nets so far this season due to injuries, rotation and health and safety agreements, while Carey Owen has been out for two weeks for personal reasons - according to league sources, his absence is very disturbing. Nevertheless, the nets still play the most efficient offense in the League - 118.2 points per 100 rounds. Their poor defense has also improved recently. In the first 26 games, their defense ranks 27th in the league, while in the last 11 games, their defense ranks 16th.

There is no doubt that harden is the main catalyst for the team's transformation. After joining the nets, he can contribute 25.5 points, 11.4 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game. More importantly, harden provides the team with much-needed verbal leadership, and he will point out the mistakes of his teammates.

Harden left the Houston Rockets, decided to join the nets, mainly because he will pursue the championship in the first place. "Our ultimate goal is to fight for the championship and win the championship, which is one of the reasons why I joined the Brooklyn nets. I think everyone in the league has the same feeling." Harden said in an interview during the all star weekend.

League sources said that the emergence of harden has brought a huge impact on Owen, which is so harmonious with the backcourt partner, which is particularly important in Durant's absence due to a left leg injury.

"In Houston, James (harden) will complain about everything to Ted brown, chief executive of the Rockets. He will trade a lot of stars and the rockets give him too much control. But in Brooklyn, he wasn't self-centered. He was always very courteous, well behaved and created opportunities for others. He's very good at self-control An alliance source familiar with the situation said.
