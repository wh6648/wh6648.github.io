"No matter what the result of next week's inspection is, Durant will go through the proper process of increasing strength before coming back Nash said.

The nets will play against Celtic tomorrow. Kevin Durant will continue to be absent due to a hamstring injury. This is Durant's 10th consecutive absence.

"After the second medical image scan, we knew it would be a longer recovery period. We had expected this to last for a month. " Nash said of Durant's successive absence.

In addition, new recruit Blake Griffin will also be absent due to a left knee injury, and his debut in the nets will be delayed. Manager Nash acknowledged that Griffin was obviously different from his peak, but praised Griffin for his passing, wisdom and understanding of the game.
