On May 4, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James talked about the playoff in an interview.

"If we end up in fifth or sixth place, or in playoff playoffs, anyway... The problem is - whoever came up with this bad idea should be fired." James said in an interview with reporters.

It is worth mentioning that last season, when the NBA was suspended due to the new coronavirus epidemic, James once publicly supported the play off in the program. He said that the league can't play directly in the playoffs after the lockout. According to the results at that time, the kings, the Blazers, the Grizzlies and other teams can have several direct duels to decide the playoff seats.

"One thing you can't do is play directly in the playoffs, because it makes teams who have fought for this position for more than 60 games lose confidence," James said in a Yahoo Sports podcast. "Teams like Portland, Memphis, pelicans and kings... So if there are 5-10 games left, why can't they fight to the death? Let them play a few games to decide the playoffs

Now, however, James's attitude has reversed, which has also caused a big wave of exaggeration. Commenter Perkins said of James's remarks: "the playoffs make the game more interesting, because every time the playoffs approach, the game becomes very boring, and those players who are hopeless in the early playoffs no longer compete." At the same time, Perkins also said James should be angry that his teammates didn't keep the fruits of his victory, rather than the playoff system.

"I'm not a fan of the playoffs. If you don't win 50%, I don't want you in the playoffs. But when you (James) ranked in the top two in the west, you didn't say anything about it, and now you say it because you find that you have to fight to avoid the playoffs, which is something he has to consider Stephen A. Smith, a famous commentator, said.

According to the playoff rules, after the end of the regular season, the seventh to tenth teams in each division can participate in the playoff playoff playoff playoff, the seventh against the eighth and the ninth against the tenth. The winner of the first group can directly lock in the seventh place in the regular season, and the loser of the second group can be eliminated directly. Next, the loser between 7th and 8th will play another game with the winner between 9th and 10th to decide the final playoff seat.
