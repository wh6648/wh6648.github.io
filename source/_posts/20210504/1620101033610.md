Recently, waterbirds are in a fierce state, while Zion is in a fierce state. Even if they miss the playoff, pelicans will be the most dangerous troublemaker in the rest of the regular season, because youth and talent represent uncertainty. The pelicans lost 108-123 to the warriors on May 4, 2021, with Ingram scoring 19 points and Zion 32.

Zion seems to have outdone Ingram this season and become the team's first offensive choice. But the warriors side of the preparation is very fast, green even at the beginning of the first quarter in a row at both ends of the attack and defense to suppress Zion, a one-on-one block, a three-point. The first to help Pelican open the situation and deadlock is Ingram, like Durant's sickle shot. Ingram still has absolute misplaced shooting ability at the critical moment.

Of course, from the choice of offensive tactics, Zion showed enough aggressiveness and began to play in the interior continuously. Zion really had a sense of small O'Neill's vision in mobility and confrontation. Six minutes in the first quarter, Zion launched an attack from the left this time. After holding the ball, he hung two people's defense on his body, or put the ball directly into the air, showing the super long stagnation. The pelican Zion was the best in the first quarter, scoring 10 points.

The pelican's most disappointing is obviously Bauer, his offensive choice and grasp, is simply unreasonable, even three consecutive close to the counter attack layup did not complete, the second quarter has just started 8 shooting 0, pelican was once again pulled to nearly 20 points of the culprit. It wasn't until 5 minutes in the second quarter that Bauer broke the scoring gap and broke the ice with a horizontal strike board. However, it was still difficult to cover up his half-time depression and delayed performance.

If the pelican that is scattered is the most aggressive person, it is still Zion. In the third minute of the second quarter, Zion dribbled against green alone this time. He directly butted green to make progress in the air, and then hit the goal with his dream. What came true in a row was very strong. In the third quarter, Zion continued to play in the interior line, and even once he held the ball more than four people's defense and made a direct layup to complete the difficult 2 + 1 shot. The team was once 25 points behind to 9 points. In the fourth minute of the third quarter, Zion was still in pursuit of defense and directly nailed Kuri.

The node of the game appeared in the second half of the third quarter. Johnson's fouls on green and technical fouls disrupted the rhythm of the team. In the fourth quarter, the pelican had been completely passive, but Zion was still conscientious. In the last nine minutes of the last quarter, Zion directly responded to the empty catch after half-time dribbling, which showed his skillful organizational talent. Indeed, Zion was the pelican's only strong point and bright point in this game. In the sixth minute of the fourth quarter, Zion broke through the four men's siege and hit 2 + 1 by riding his dream. This time, he showed his signature action of showing his muscles. This season, Zion has dunked and broken through the interior line 550 times, more than the second letter brother up to 100 times, which shows how powerful the deterrent force is. Although the pelican lost to the warriors in the end, Zion was still trapped and brave. He lost the ball but didn't lose.
