It was reported on May 4 that the Phoenix Suns are currently ranked first in the western region with a 46-18 record, and their goal is to take the top three positions in the western region. Today, the Suns are in the headlines again, though this time for quite different reasons. According to ESPN reporter Nick depaula, the sun's famous mascot gorilla made history.

"The Suns mascot gorilla has signed a footwear and clothing agreement with guest list, a street clothing boutique in Phoenix, which will sponsor the shoes and clothing he wears during the game. This is also the first team mascot sports endorsement agreement in history." ESPN reporter Nick depaula reports.

"It means a lot to our brand. We've always been a part of this place. Both players and fans will come to our store for consumption, and thank the community for their support. It's great to work with the Suns this time. In this way, we can better integrate into the game and the team and play a certain role Ryan gizinski, head of guest list, said in a statement.

For the Suns, they have a lot to be excited about. Throughout the season, the Suns are in control of their own destiny, they are expected to enter the playoffs as the number one seed in the West. Now the team mascot gorilla has also made history. The mascot of the Suns is a gorilla named gorilla, nicknamed "go", which is also the league's most fancy dunk mascot. It has been the mascot of the Suns since 1980.
