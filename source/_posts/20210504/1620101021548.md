Curry is really playing his own season after the 2016 season, but for the warriors, their season is not over, and Curry's journey is far from over. On May 4, 2021, the warriors beat the pelicans 123-108, with curry scoring 41 points and 8 assists. He won 40 + for the ninth time this season, leading the league.

In May, curry was still in a good condition, especially when he was shooting wildly when he didn't come up from the outside line. On the contrary, he succeeded in starting the game with two consecutive conversion layups, which seemed to be the way the warriors did the opposite in the beginning. As expected, the pelicans made a perfect 17-5 start. The first quarter minutes, curry and Green's pick and roll skilfully, a fast counter run and hand to hand pass, curry hit his first three points.

When curry is not crazy to shoot three points, the warriors' attack will be more full of threat, and the tension of sudden points will be better. In the second half of the first quarter, the pelicans began to trap curry. As one of the worst defensive teams in the League (the third from the bottom), curry grasped this mentality. In the first three minutes, curry made a direct assist to Wiggins by being trapped, and completed the empty dunk.

In the last two minutes of the first quarter, curry killed his heart. First, he singled out James Johnson in the logo position to hit the super long three points, and then he singled out Zion by dislocation. After changing direction continuously, he hit the three points again. In just 26 seconds, curry hit two super three points and pulled the score to 20. In the first quarter, curry scored 17 points, which laid a very good rhythm for the team. In contrast, in the second quarter, curry felt average and scored 4 points.

In the third quarter, as the pelicans began to encroach on their own advantages, curry immediately dribbled the ball on the left three-point line to pick up the blood cloth, which directly swung the blood cloth to hit three points, then staggered to hit three points against Zion, which opened the difference again for six consecutive points. In the sixth minute of the third quarter, curry once again made a hand-in-hand three-point throw. It has to be said that the pick and roll coordination of curry and green is the warriors' most lethal weapon. In the third quarter, the game was interrupted by Johnson kicking green, while pelicans had already reached 7 points, but they were in a mess because of this node. Curry was very good at seizing the opportunity, picked Bauer to hit three points in the chaos.

As the third quarter of the season's scoring king, curry ushered in the third quarter of the individual outbreak, thus laying the foundation for the harvest game. Three quarters later, curry had 36 points. In this game, curry's judgment of pelican's defense, as well as the perfect rhythm and performance of pick and roll attack led the team to win the key victory away from home.
