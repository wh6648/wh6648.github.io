On July 4, according to a report by the famous reporter of the Olympic, Samas chalaniya, a well-informed person revealed that the Clippers guard Patrick Beverly was suspended from the League for violating sports ethics for pushing Chris Paul from behind.

As the clippers have finished this season's journey, Beverly's suspension will be implemented next season, and his salary will be deducted.

Beverly is a famous villain in the league. But you know what? It is the first time in Beverly's career that he has been punished by the League for involvement in on-the-field incidents with other players, and it is also the first time that he has been suspended. Previously, Beverly was fined for the first five times in his career because of quarrels or conflicts with fans or referees.

The Suns beat the Clippers in the G6 Western Conference finals on Thursday to advance to the finals 4-2 overall. During a pause in the fourth quarter, Beverly pushed Paul from behind, causing CP3 to fall to the ground. After the referee intervened, Beverly was directly expelled.

Because Beverly's move was directly recorded on TV, it caused a huge repercussion on social media. The next day, Beverly apologized to Paul through social media, and he wrote "@ Paul, I was a little out of control. It's my fault, but it's not against you. Congratulations on getting to the finals. Good luck

Beverly became the focus of attention in the Western Conference finals. In the second half of series G2, Beverly and Devon Booker collided and both of them returned to the dressing room bleeding. Because of the collision, Booker's nose was injured, forcing him to wear a mask.

Beverly signed a three-year $40 million contract in the summer of 2019, which will expire in 2022. Next season is Beverly's contract year with an annual salary of $14.32 million.
