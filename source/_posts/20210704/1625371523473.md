It is reported on July 4 that the NBA playoffs continue today. The sixth game between the eagles and the bucks in the Eastern Conference finals begins. In this game, the eagles' role players make efforts one after another under the condition that the star Trey young does not play well. Redish makes 21 points out of 6-for-7, and Bogdanovic, Collins and Capella also score double, playing a stable role. But the Hawks still fell short in the end, losing 107-118 to bucks at home and missing the finals 2-4.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Bogdanovic took the initiative to attack, broke into the interior and hit hard shots. Then he picked up Forbes to lay up and received Trey Young's assist. Bogdanovic did not hesitate to open his hand and hit three points. Trey - Yang after the next break, the eagles were opponents play a wave of small climax, at this time Gallinari stepped forward, even in two three-point steady situation. Entering the second quarter, Capella began to show his strength in the interior line, frequently taking off the front rebounds with active fighting and scoring the second attack. In this section, Bogdanovic encountered the other side's strict defense. It's hard to get an easy shot in the sports war. He only relied on the free throw to win 4 points. After half-time, the hawks were 43-47 behind the bucks.

After Capella's second attack, the Hawks' attack suddenly stagnated and was hit by a 13-0 climax. At the critical moment, redish stepped forward and made a three-point shot on both sides to stop bleeding slightly. After that, he was out of control and hit three-point shots in succession. Enter the last section of the fight, redish's good hand has been extended, attack and defense conversion in the next Trey - Yang assists in the storm in three points, blowing the counterattack horn. Collins is not willing to be outdone, the interior team-mates successive assists. In the second half of this section, redish helped the team narrow the difference to only 10 points. However, since then, the Hawks have been unable to resist the Bucks' attack on the defensive end, and finally failed to realize the turnover. Unfortunately, they were eliminated after a defeat.

The eagles can finally reach the Eastern Conference finals this season, of course, thanks to Trey Young's superstar level performance in the whole season, but the stable play of role players is also indispensable, especially the interior dual nucleus Collins and Capella have completely become the foundation for this team to stand in the top ranks of the Eastern conference. The offensive end of the two in the Trey - Yang feeding cake, the field can contribute to double-digit scores, but the two are not completely dependent on Trey - Yang drive. Collins has developed a more stable ability of outside shooting this season, with a shooting percentage of 50% and a free throw percentage of 80%. Capella swept away the inherent impression of "pie king" and gained more opportunities for himself and the whole team by actively fighting. He can average more than 11 rebounds in the whole playoffs.

In the outside, Bogdanovic and Hart play the role of Trey Yang's right arm very well. Both of them have excellent three-point projection ability and good grasp of the ball attack, which makes the eagles' attack not completely depend on Trey Yang. Bench veteran Lu Wei came to the team after the same remarkable, especially in the Trey - Yang injury, Lu Wei came forward to lead the team to win the East G4 victory, so that the team will not immediately into despair. As for the Italian cannons Gallinari and redish, although their performance is not stable throughout the season, when it comes to the critical moment, they can stand up to help the team, which proves that they have a strong heart. In the future, the eagles want to attack higher goals, none of them are indispensable.
