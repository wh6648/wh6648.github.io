According to the news on July 4, former Cleveland Cavaliers player Channing Frye recently revealed an offensive about LeBron James in an interview. He described in detail what James said to Cavaliers teammates when they stopped shooting because of confidence problems.

James is one of the best leaders in the NBA, both verbally and by example. Obviously, he wants to make his teammates better. Any team with healthy James is a strong competitor. Although James was eliminated in the first round of this season's playoffs because of the team's injury problems, the Lakers will still be a strong competitor next season. Many NBA shooters like to play with James because James is also a good motivator. James usually puts his teammates in the right place to make them successful. Channing fry recently revealed in an interview that if James gives you a pass but you don't shoot, he will give you a look.

"So, if he (James) passes the ball to you and you don't dare to do it this time because you missed the first two shots, he will treat you as a madman, and then he will say," don't you think I know what I'm doing? Shoot! " I will say¡® Damn, you're LeBron, so I should shoot next time. It's all encouraging, it's all good, he's one of my best teammates Said Frye.
