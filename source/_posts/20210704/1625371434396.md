On July 4, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Milwaukee Bucks meet Atlanta Hawks in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference finals. At the end of the game, the Bucks beat the Hawks 118-107, eliminated their opponents 4-2 and advanced to the finals.

Statistics show that this is the Bucks history of the third finals trip, the last time they achieved such results, it was 1974, that is 47 years ago.

When the Bucks win today's game, they can celebrate for a short time.

But looking back at the end of last season, the Bucks were still in a mess. At that time, the Bucks were beaten by the heat, and when he returned to the dressing room with his head down, no one knew whether he would come back next season.

At that time, a mainstream voice believed that the Bucks' lineup was about to disintegrate.

However, after the off-season, the Bucks' management went against the trend. Instead of giving up, they didn't think about the future ahead of time. On the contrary, in order to retain the letter brother, the Bucks were willing to take a huge risk. When the introduction of Bogdan Bogdanovic failed, they resolutely launched a big deal and sent bradso away in exchange for holliday, In addition, he added real-time combat power such as Bobbie pottis and Forbes to the bench.

Bucks sincerity finally moved the letter brother, let him accept the top salary contract extension to stay in the team option. After the start of the new season, around the running in of the new team, everyone is also making adjustments and sacrifices.

Although, from the record point of view, the regular season, Bucks this season is not as good as the past two years, and the letter brother also retired from the ranks of MVP competition. However, the Bucks' accumulated strength finally broke out in the playoffs.

In the first round of the series, facing the "enemy" heat, the Bucks did not waste a ball and completed the sweep revenge 4-0; In the second round, the Bucks encountered a strong rebound net. When they were 2-0 behind in the first two games, they quickly adjusted and eliminated the number one favorite after seven fierce games.

To the Eastern Conference finals, the letter brother's accidental injury once again disrupted the deployment of the Bucks, but under the leadership of Middleton and Holliday, they managed to laugh to the end.

Although, this year's playoffs, the Bucks promotion journey is also tainted, such as the semi-finals, the letter brother Owen's "foot event.". However, people have to admit that today's bucks are more mature and confident than in the past few years.

The source of Bucks' confidence should come from the new aid Huo ledi. It is holiday brother's joining that makes the team have a real strong team temperament, so that the team can be calm and not lose the chain in critical moments.

It is also because of the existence of Holliday that Middleton can play more freely. He can feel at ease to accumulate his strength in some periods, and then focus his scoring talent in a short time. In the East duel, rice God scored 20 + twice in the single section, which is the best embodiment.

Now, the bucks are on the stage of the finals as they wish, but what's worse is that they still can't play because of knee injury. In the finals, if the Bucks still play with this remnant, they may not be able to take advantage of the more complete lineup and more sophisticated playing style of the sun.
