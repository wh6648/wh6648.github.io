July 4 news, in today's NBA League, few players like Carey Owen are frequently put under the microscope by the media. The story of the All Star Defender's time with Celtic continues into his tenure with the Brooklyn nets, whether it's unstable leadership or off court headaches. Obviously, it's hard for Owen to get rid of the negative comments about him, but his former teammate Jason Tatum expressed his support for Owen in a discussion with host Ashley nevel on the "beyond the press" podcast.

"As I said before, he (Owen) was misunderstood. I'm sure he apologized and regretted (if not) for what he had done or said before, "Tatum said." but, you know, each of us has done something we shouldn't be proud of, or said something we shouldn't have said. "

Tatum sympathizes with Owen's situation and calls on people not to be too hard on him¡° In the world we live in, everyone's judgment is too simple and quick, which is unfair. We're just living in the spotlight, and I'm sure that if we put all the guys who blame and talk about us on TV in our situation, when everything they say and do becomes national news, they won't do it perfectly Tatum continued.
