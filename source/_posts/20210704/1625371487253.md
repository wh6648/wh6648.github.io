On July 4, it was reported that the sixth game between the bucks and the hawks in the Eastern Conference finals of NBA playoffs started today. The Hawks star Trey Yang came back with injury, but he didn't adjust to the best condition. He only contributed 14 points, 4 rebounds and 9 assists in 4 of 17 shots, which failed to help the Hawks turn the tide. In the end, the eagles lost 107-118 to the bucks at home and were eliminated 2-4 in the total score.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Trey Yang's personal attack was not very active, but he chose to lead his teammates first. Seeing that the attack efficiency of his teammates was not high, Trey Yang burst into the interior line to send a wonderful pass to assist Capella to complete the air to receive the slam dunk. Then he personally operated the knife and made a 2 + 1 gliding throw. Entering the second quarter, Trey Yang returned to the field to score, assist with two hands, help Collins with a wonderful pass, and then hit the inside layup with the ball. However, this section of Trey - Yang can not find outside touch, long-distance shot in succession to hit the iron end. After half-time, the hawks were 43-47 behind the bucks.

Another fight on the other side, the eagle attack suddenly cut off power, and was pulled back to double digits by the opponent's wave. Trey - Yang qiangtu glided under the basket to make a layup, and finally broke the scoring shortage, but he made two three-point shots in this section and still got nothing. At the end of the third quarter, the Hawks are 19 points behind. Entering the last section of the competition, Trey Yang strengthened his personal breakthrough, scored 4 points with a free throw, and also helped his teammates to score continuously. The Hawks played a wave to narrow the difference to 10 points. However, after that, the Bucks didn't panic at the offensive end, and the Hawks couldn't effectively limit their opponents and further narrow the difference. Finally, they regretted a defeat, losing 2-4 in the total score and missed the finals.

Although the final failed to lead the Hawks a black in the end to reach the finals, but this year's playoffs, Trey - Yang undoubtedly played a superstar level performance. In the first round against the Knicks, Trey Yang can contribute 29.2 points and 9.8 assists per game, leading the Hawks to achieve the following goals. In the face-to-face confrontation with Randall, Trey Yang has completely occupied the advantage of the rolling level, which makes the two teams with similar performance in the regular season appear to be quite different in the post-season. In the second round, facing the first 76 in the East, the Hawks are obviously not optimistic. However, it was Trey young who gave a heavy blow to the strong enemy with his dominant performance. Trey Yang contributed 29 points and 10.9 assists in the midfield of the seven major wars, leading the team to win the opponent through the seven major wars, and even to the near collapse of the complacent 76.

Entering the Eastern Conference finals, young Trey youngs was not afraid of such a big scene. In the first game, he handed over 48 points and 11 assists, giving the opponent a downfall. However, the fourth game of the accident injury, let the Hawks suddenly into a desperate situation. In such a team with Trey young as the absolute attack core, his absence completely disrupted the Hawks' game strategy. Although he forced his comeback in today's game, it can be seen that the ankle injury made him unable to do his best on the field, and the Hawks also missed the best hope.
