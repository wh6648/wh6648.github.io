On July 4, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Milwaukee Bucks meet Atlanta Hawks in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference finals. At the end of the game, the Bucks beat the Hawks 118-107, eliminated their opponents 4-2 and advanced to the finals.

The eagles lost to bucks in six games, and the journey of the season also stopped on the stage of the Eastern Conference finals.

Undeniably, this round of series, the Hawks' defeat has the core Trey - Yang Yi's factor.

But in the final analysis, there is still a huge gap between the eagles and the bucks in paper combat power. When blowing Yang is injured, the eagles can create some surprise effects by adjusting for a short time, and they can take the bucks by surprise and steal a victory. However, once the Bucks see the move, once the two sides "card" against the war, the eagle will not take advantage of.

You know, the regular season, the Hawks is a strong offensive defensive weak team, in the defensive end, their efficiency is ranked in the League more than 20. So, when it comes to the playoffs, especially in the whole round of the series, the eagles are suppressed by the Bucks most of the time, and they are seriously behind in the scoring, rebounding and other important indicators.

The G6 battle of life and death, although blowing Yang back with injury, but the effect is very bad, the Hawks not only defense continues to be flawed, in the attack with the Bucks also gradually lost. When the Bucks not only take what they want from the inside, but also blossom more from the outside, and huoledi and Middleton feel hot, the suspense of the game will naturally lose.

However, we must praise the patience of the eagles in recent years and the timely adjustment of the team this season.

Since June 2017, the eagles hired Travis Schlenk, a senior manager of the warriors department, as the new general manager of the team, and started the push down and reconstruction, they have a quite clear goal. They want to build a mobile and fast lineup with three break-up as the main framework in comparison with the warriors. Finally, after four years of hard work, Schlenk excellently completed the task.

Today, the eagles have one of the most talented scorers in the new generation, Trey young. Beside him, there are a group of outstanding young people, including John Collins, de Andre hunt, Schult and redish.

In addition, the addition of Bogdan Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Louis Williams and "pie emperor" Capella makes the team's lineup more reasonable.

Although at the beginning of this season, the eagles experienced a series of disturbances, such as infighting and changing the coach, but under the strong correction of new coach Nate McMillan, the eagles gradually stepped out of the quagmire, rose strongly in the later part of the season, and finally realized the talent of the team.

However, the Hawks lineup is not perfect, a playoff down, they see the gap between themselves and the real strong team. Off season, the Hawks management also need to continue to upgrade the lineup. First, John Collins, the second in command, is facing a new contract. Considering the friction between him and the team in the past two years, and the differences between the asking price of the Collins camp and the senior management of the Hawks, it is a big question mark whether he can stay in the future.

In addition, the young stars of the team, redish and hunt, did not fully show their ability in the playoffs because of injuries. Schulter was reused, but he had obvious shortcomings in defense. Off season, how to train these people, will also be the focus of the eagles.

Facts have proved that Yang's attacking talent and the attacking firepower of the whole hawks team are quite excellent when he is boasting about his health. But as a team with ideas to win the championship, the eagles still need to work hard on the defensive side. They need to find some really tough defenders to join, and they need to work hard to make the attack and defense more balanced.
