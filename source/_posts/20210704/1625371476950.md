On July 4, the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 118-107 in the sixth game of the NBA Eastern Conference finals, knocked out the Hawks 4-2 to advance to the finals. Middleton once again staged a dazzling performance with 20 + points in a single quarter. He scored 32 points, 4 rebounds and 7 assists in the whole game, proving his worth of 100 million yuan with 23 points in the third quarter.

The Bucks core has been out of games 5 and 6 of the series since he was injured in the third quarter in Game 4, but the Bucks' 3-2 lead is one of the reasons why he dares to rest.

What's more wonderful is that the Bucks suppressed the Hawks from the beginning. The only drawback is that Middleton's hand is very general. He played for 20 minutes in two quarters, but he only had 5 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists in 2-for-6 shots, and there were as many as six mistakes.

Unexpectedly, in the third quarter, the situation on the field suddenly changed, Middleton once again "ruthless" possession.

In the short 70 seconds at the beginning of the third quarter, Middleton scored 8 points in a row, especially after an in-house layup. Mr. Yi Yuan scored two 3 points in a row at the bottom corner and the top of the arc, helping the Bucks regain a 10 point lead.

After the pause, Middleton continued to eat inside, he broke through the left-handed throw into 2 + 1. After that, he continued to stop the CIC, and Middleton scored 16 points in a row.

In less than 4 minutes, Middleton played a 16-2 attack, with his own strength to expand the difference to more than 15 points.

In the third game of the series, Middleton broke out in the last quarter. He made 8 of 13 shots, 4 of 6 three-point shots, and one man shot down 20 points and 3 rebounds. It was completely relying on one man's firepower to help the Bucks complete the 15 point reversal.

Unexpectedly, the same scene appeared again in the sixth game, but this time Middleton advanced the outbreak period to the third quarter, which obviously caught the eagles by surprise. In the 10 minutes of the third quarter, Middleton made 8 of 12 shots, 4 of 7 three-point shots, and scored 23 points in a single quarter, totally exceeding the performance of 20 points at the end of the third game.

The 23 points set a new record for Middleton's NBA career in a single quarter. His previous record was 21 points in the third quarter against the heat in September last year. This is also the fourth time that Middleton has scored 15 + points in a single quarter in the playoffs. This season, Middleton is the third man in the league, second only to Mitchell and Durant, both of whom have scored five times.

In the last quarter, although Middleton was not as hot as the third quarter, he relied on himself to attract firepower and assist his teammates in a row. At the same time, he also scored four free throws. The data of the game was set at 32 points, 4 rebounds and 7 assists.
