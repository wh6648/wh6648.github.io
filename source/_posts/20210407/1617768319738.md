This season the Los Angeles Lakers introduced mark Gasol to replace Dwight Howard, who left, has been controversial. Pau Gasol looks old and ridiculed as "old cold leg" by the fans, for fear that the media will release rumors that "the Lakers plan to buy out Pau Gasol". Zhuang Shen's joining made Gasol's playing time further reduced, and also made Gasol's mood fluctuate. He refused to be interviewed by the media several times. After defeating king, he complained to the media: "sometimes I ask myself what I did wrong. I feel like I'm Plan D of the team." Fortunately, coach Vogel and his teammates expressed their support for Gasol in time. "Gasol has set an example for young people, he will not fall out of rotation," Vogel said Matthews said: "Gasol has a positive attitude, he deserves more praise."

Put aside the PR crisis, let's talk about the matter. What is the strength and role of Gasol this season?

Little Gasol joined Memphis Grizzlies in 2008 (Grizzlies traded Paul Gasol for mark Gasol's signing right from the Lakers, which is known as brother for brother in History). Since then, he and Randolph formed the black and white double bears that made the League daunting, and adopted the anti era trend of double towers to occupy the ranks of the Western superpowers. Little Gasol and Randolph are all-round players, they can both play high and low positions. Comparatively speaking, Randolph played more low positions, such as Griffin and Perkins; Gasol played more high positions, facing little Jordan and Ibaka, which made the strong team clippers and thunder upset at that time. Grizzlies failed to break through the western region because they had a nemesis in the western region, the Spurs. Grizzlies once met the Spurs in the 2011 season, but it was difficult for them to win. The main reason was that Grizzlies' double towers were helpless in the face of the Spurs' pick and roll, zipper and fold attack, and their defense line was easily cut by their opponents. Gasol is very comprehensive, can shoot high, can play low back singles, and has first-class coordination and defense ability. His shortcomings are slow movement, fear of pick and roll and small guard roll call, and his rebounds are not top-notch. In recent years, with age, the attack has degenerated and the movement has been slow. Last season, the Toronto Raptors cut his playing time and added five hours to drag the Boston Celtics into seven games.

This season, Gasol from Raptors to the Lakers, he really has unsatisfactory places: first, the lack of offensive firepower, he averaged 4.9 points + 4 boards + 2 assists, occasionally do high and low singles, most of the time do empty projection and high and low coordination; second, the defensive end moves slowly, run to the outside line to assist defense, can't run back to protect the basket, will be called by the small guard, He can't go on the line like he did in the 19-year finals. Curry can shrink back and put pressure on him.

But he's still an important part of the Lakers. He can open space at the offensive end and create offensive opportunities for his teammates; he can stand flexibly, paint the area, high position, low position, elbow area and outside the three-point line; he can shoot three points (36.6% of the three-point shooting rate), or score by pick and roll (mainly by receiving and returning shots, 1 point by pick and roll per game, 50% of the shooting rate), and occasionally do low single half cut baskets; He can also provide high-quality strong side or weak side of the pick and roll cover quality, he can do with LeBron and Schroeder pick and roll cooperation, play high pick and roll, he can expand the projection to help the ball holder pull space (Howard can only follow, can't help filling the ball holder's space), can also be in the weak side of the shooter group for no ball cover; he can provide high and low coordination function, in the attack and defense conversion can push fast attack, He has two assists this season, mainly for James, Schroeder, pop and Kuzma. His shortcoming is that he can't get the score by eating the cake, and he doesn't have a strong desire to sell. This is where he has been criticized.

His defense seems to be underestimated by the media and the fans of the Lakers. The defense efficiency is 103 (the team ranks second, next to the thick eyebrow), the high-level data DWS is 1.6, dbpm is 3.0, drpm is 2.15, all pretty good. He doesn't have Howard's defensive momentum and celebratory action in appearance; as a smart defender, he can skillfully use defensive skills to contain the opponent in single defense; he won't excessively expand and attack when changing defense; he uses strong body, moderate contraction and accurate running to block the opponent. Another influence of Gasol's joining is that the Laker has increased the proportion of regional joint defense. For example, 2-3 regional joint defense and one eye four joint defense are Gasol's specialties. He is widely used in Grizzlies, raptors and FIBA Spain national team. His basket protection effect is also good, reducing the opponent's hit rate by 4.7%.

When we compare Gasol with Howard (last season), we will find that Gasol's overall defensive performance is not worse than Howard last season. The three-point line is not as good as Howard, but the basket guard and midfield position defense are better than Howard. There is an objective factor here. Coach Vogel has optimized the defensive system this season, enriched the regional joint defense, full court press and other contents, coupled with the growth of Kuzma and other players, the defense has reached a higher level, and the defensive efficiency is as high as 105.6. Even in the case of Jamie's long absence, he still ranks first in the league. The system and players can make up for Gasol's shortcomings. There are obvious differences between the two defensive styles. Howard mainly focuses on squatting defense, but he is too active in attacking the three-point line, which makes the opponent easy to use pick and roll to break into the half block or throw, which affects Howard's defense in the midshot area. Gasol's style of avoiding expansion makes his defense poor on the three-point line, but he is suitable for shrinking the basket to control the midshot area, which makes him better than Howard.

Gasol can play double towers together or as a single inside (single tower) player. He and thick eyebrow's double tower can be inside and outside, can be double outside line position, can be a low arc top, a low one weak side, can also switch with each other, changeable, mutual aid effect, more in line with the spirit of modern space basketball; Gasol and thick eyebrow double tower confrontation, than thick eyebrow and Howard double tower more flexible and reasonable, because Howard can only stand inside line, double tower position is much more rigid. Vogel will also try his partner with Harrell to make use of Gasol's coordination ability to provide convenience for Harrell to attack the basket.

Gasol has its value, but he has fatal shortcomings, can not support too much playing time, in the regular season, the Lakers were forced to introduce Jones or Zhuang Shen to increase center rotation. But Zhuang Shen can not completely replace Gasol's role, he mainly enriches the configuration of the center of the Lakers and provides different choices. Gasol is the slow center of defending basket, Zhuangshen is the center of defending basket, Harrell is the fast center of attacking, Damo is the center of projecting, and Nongmei is the center of attacking and defending. These five different "ingredients" can make different flavors. It's up to coach Vogel to watch the dishes. Superstar Nongmei can only mention the position of center at the critical moment, and play power forward at the regular moment. The other four centers are of great significance, and Gasol has rich experience in the playoffs compared with the other three, which is his advantage.
