Minnesota Timberwolves star Carl Anthony Downes revealed today that he had received his first dose of the new coronavirus vaccine a week before the first anniversary of his mother's unfortunate death from the new coronavirus, and Downes also uploaded a photo of him vaccinating his left arm.

These two years have been really hard for Downes. In the 2019-20 season, Downes only played 35 games due to injury, and the experience of Downes outside the court was even more heartbreaking. In March 2020, Downes' mother was positive for new coronavirus, and her symptoms were very serious. In order to save her life, doctors once put on a ventilator, but it didn't work, and she died on April 13. According to Downes, seven of his family members died of the new coronavirus.

"The new coronavirus has always been very unfriendly to me. I pray every day that the nightmare of this virus will soon disappear. I beg you to take it seriously and take all necessary preventive measures. We can't stop the spread of this virus alone. It must be resisted by all of us united." Downes said.

In addition, Downes himself also confirmed the new crown, since then he has been receiving treatment, absent from 13 games, until February 11, the Timberwolves and Clippers game, Downes finally officially comeback. Speaking of the time when he was ill, Downes still had a lingering fear: "I am not an asymptomatic infected person. I am a high-risk patient. I have spent many horrible nights. I'm ashamed of the treatment and the resources I've received, and people all over the world deserve it. "

So far this season, Downes has played 31 games, averaging 24.6 points, 11.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.5 blocks.
