On April 7, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continues, and the Los Angeles Lakers challenge the Toronto Raptors away. At the end of the game, the Lakers beat the Raptors 110-101 to avoid losing in a row.

In this battle, in the case of Zhuang Shen still injured, Xiao Jia continued to act as a fireman in the interior. As a result, he played well, with 13 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 blocks, boosting the victory of the Lakers.

Originally, in the "Zhuang Shen" Andre - Drummond joined the Lakers, little Gasol has lost his position. In an interview, Xiaojia also pessimistic said, "I know I will soon fall out of rotation at a certain point in time."

However, Zhuang Shen was injured suddenly after his first show and joined the healing team. Xiao Jia was ordered to start the game and his appearance was very different from before.

Come to today's game, on the old club raptors, small plus and after the opening to show their talent. In the first attack of the Lakers, Xiaojia missed the throw with the ball. However, with his excellent judgment, he grabbed the rebound from the front court. Then, he distributed the ball to Kuzma, who was unattended on the outside line, and the latter easily shot the three-point ball.

Next, the pie eater changed to Xiaojia himself, who received Schroeder's pass and made an easy layup. Not only in defense, but also in attack. You know, before the game, small plus slow pace will often become the opponent's weakness. But at least this night, the small plus's change of defense, defense is quite in place, he seems to dream back to the peak, back to the best defensive player when the state.

Not only that, in the rebound protection, small plus also very good.

Since the injury of brother Nongmei, the inside of the Lakers has been short of major general, but in the latter part of the first quarter, monterice Harrell, an important inside of the purple gold army, was directly expelled because he played for teammate Schroeder. In this case, the small plus has become the Laker inside the last hope.

Xiaojia didn't disappoint his teammates. After that, he smoothly switched between scoring, coordination, defense and other functions. He completely acted as the lubricant for the offensive end of the Lakers. When the team needed to score, he could also take out his own delicate skill pack.

Also relying on the small plus drive, the Lakers easily established a 20 point advantage in the second quarter, the most time, they led to 30 +.

The Raptors didn't give up when they fell behind. They continued to attack the position of the Lakers and tried to challenge the inside line again and again. However, they obviously miscalculated. Small plus state is extremely good, he used a strong block, repeatedly refused to attack the Raptors.

It took almost three quarters for the Lakers to kill the suspense. In this game, the first victory of the Lakers belongs to Gasol. It's no wonder, before that, Lakers coach Vogel once stressed, "little plus will help us win the championship this year He will be an important part of our pursuit of the championship and he is one of the most important players
