It was reported on June 1 that the Wizards beat the 76ers 122-114 at home, catching up to 1-3. It is worth mentioning that in the third quarter of the game, another farce happened.

There were 3 minutes and 40 seconds left in the third quarter, when the wizard was 80-74 ahead of 76. Suddenly a fan in a yellow shirt rushed into the stadium. The referee found the intruder and was forced to suspend the game. However, when the fan failed to do anything, he was immediately knocked down and captured by the security personnel on the sidelines, handcuffed and taken out of the stadium.

The wizard official then announced that the fan was banned from the game at the wizard's home and was charged by the Washington D.C. police department. The video shows that the fan only took a few seconds to rush down from the stands, but when he rushed to the basket, he didn't touch or get close to any players.

With the gradual release of the number of fans in each stadium, some fans' extreme behavior has affected the order of the stadium. This is just another example of the misbehavior of the fans in the past week. In Philadelphia, a fan throws popcorn at Russell Westbrook; In New York, a fan spat on Trey young; In Utah, Jia Morant's family was ridiculed by three fans; In Boston, a Celtic fan threw a water bottle at Carey Owen.
