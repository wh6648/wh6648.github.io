On June 1, the NBA playoffs continued today. The 76ers, who have already got the match point, challenge the Wizards away. The 76 Man Star of the game, nbid, fell to the ground injured in an attack at the end of the first quarter and withdrew from the game. Only 11 minutes before the injury, he got 8 points in 2 of 6 shots, 6 rebounds, 2 assists and 1 steals. In the end, the 76ers lost 114-122 to the wizards and the total score was 1-3.

At the beginning of the first quarter, enbid's desire to attack was not strong. He took the initiative to pull out of the three-point line for coordination, and gave the inside space to Harris and Simmons. His teammates did not live up to his trust, and scored continuously to help the team establish a leading position. Until the middle of this section, enbid finally began to play solo with the ball, resulting in four free throws, and then picked Ryan to hit the ball. Since then, in the face of the other side's packet defense strategy, enbid is also at ease, dexterous turn to squeeze the little Lopez layup. However, on the defensive end, enbid was caught unprepared by little Lopez, and several times he failed to defend and was continuously scored by the other side. At the end of the first quarter, the 76ers were 3 points ahead of the Wizards.

At the end of the festival, a worrying scene appeared. After falling down in an attack, nbid was injured. After a short adjustment, he returned to the dressing room for treatment. Then it was confirmed that nbid would not continue to play because of pain in his right knee.
