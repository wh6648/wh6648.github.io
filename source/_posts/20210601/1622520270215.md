On June 1, according to Adrian wojnarowski, a famous ESPN reporter, the neck strain of Dallas Mavericks star Luke dongqiqi has "improved" today.

Dong Qiqi was injured in the previous series G3 game. After the match on the spot, Dong Qiqi said that there was a "strange" feeling in his neck, causing pain in his left arm, which affected his shooting. In the G4 game, Dong Qiqi's performance was not good, only 9 of 24 shots. Coach Carlisle said in an interview: "he (Dong Qiqi) looks a little painful, as if he can't turn left, can't see to his left, it's very difficult for a person who relies on vision to play."

Adrian wojnarowski reported today that Dong Qiqi's neck strain has "improved" today. This is good news for the lone ranger, who will have more time to recover. The lone Rangers also need him to go all out in Game 5 on Thursday to win. At present, the lone ranger and the Clippers are tied 2-2.
