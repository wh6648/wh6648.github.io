Lakers coach Vogel revealed that MRI results confirmed Anthony Davis groin injury, his current state is the fifth game of the series into doubt. That means LeBron James has to take on more responsibility.

"Without Anthony Davis, the Lakers can't beat the Suns, especially when Chris Paul looks healthy. LeBron (James) will be eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in his career... The Lakers need a great LeBron James and a healthy Anthony Davis to bring the team out of this series, Just like they did in the second and third games Stephen-a-smith said.

The good news is that Davis is currently in the state of daily assessment, he is still likely to return in this round of series. James is bound to keep the Lakers competitive.
