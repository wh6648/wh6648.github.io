On June 1, basketball star Carey Owen scored 39 points and 11 rebounds in the fourth game of the playoffs series, leading the team to beat Celtic 141-126 with a 3-1 lead. It's worth mentioning that after the game, Owen walked to the center of the court to give his teammates a high five, went to the Celtic team, stepped on a foot and then turned away from the court. Owen's move angered many Celtic fans and players who used to play for Celtic, including Kevin Garnett and Glenn Davis.

Celtic legend Kevin Garnett thinks Owen's behavior is beyond the bottom line, "so no one wants to comment on Carey's stamp on the logo? Should we just turn a blind eye You shouldn't do that for whatever reason. You're not cool at all. We all need to be better. Of course, I just make complaints about it. Good morning. I hope you have a good day. " Garnett wrote on personal social media instagram.

Glen Davis also criticized Owen's writing. Davis said that Owen trampled on Celtic's team logo, which means trampling on all the players who have played for the team. It is worth mentioning that Owen's current teammate Kevin Durant has responded to Davis's remarks. He thinks Davis's views are absurd.

What attracted more media attention after the game was that on his way back to the dressing room, a Celtic fan threw a water bottle at Owen. The behaviour of the fan was unacceptable and he was punished. It is reported that the fan will be summoned for personal attack. Fans who threw water bottles at Owen have been banned from the game for life by TD garden, officials said.
