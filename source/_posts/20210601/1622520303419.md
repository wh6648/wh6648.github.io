According to reports from the US media on June 1, Laker coach Frank Vogel said in an interview today that kentavios Caldwell Pope is expected to make a comeback in the Tianwang mountain battle.

Pop didn't play in G4 because he suffered a contusion in his left knee in G3. Now Anthony Davis suffered groin injury is likely to be absent G5, the outside world is concerned about whether pop can return in G5?

"Pop is close to comeback now. He feels very good in shooting training today," Vogel said. "But he still feels uncomfortable when changing direction. We will reassess his injury tomorrow, and I personally hope he can come back tomorrow night

"My knee feels OK, much better than yesterday," Popper said in an interview today. At present, I haven't tested which actions can be done and which can't be done. Today, I had a mild but difficult training. At this stage, I don't feel any pain in my knee

If pop can come back in G5, it's definitely good news for the Lakers.

In the first three games of the series, Popper averaged 30.3 minutes, giving up 4.0 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.3 steals.
