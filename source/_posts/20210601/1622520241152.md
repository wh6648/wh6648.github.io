On June 1, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely. The Washington Wizards beat the Philadelphia 76ers 122-114, bringing the total score to 1-3. Bill contributed 27 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists in the crucial game of being swept. In the third quarter, he took over the game in an all-round way, contributing 10 points in a single quarter, and the last 45 seconds of key assists helped the wizards to finally win.

Bill hit the first goal of the game for the Wizards. As the leader of the team, he naturally didn't want to be swept by the 76ers.

With three minutes left in the first quarter of the game, Bill lost his shoes on the offensive run. To make matters worse, Bill limped to the bench, as if injured. Sitting off the court, Bill communicates with the team doctor and looks embarrassed.

After a simple adjustment, Bill returned to the field, but like the first quarter, bill was still 2-for-6 in a single quarter. The first two sessions, he made 4 points in 12, got 10 points, and he didn't have awesome performance. Fortunately, the role players of the Wizards gave power, so Bill's half court efficiency was negative 4, and the team's lowest.

In this series, Bill averaged 30.3 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, while his shooting percentage reached 48%. However, Bill's three-point touch is not flattering. He only made three of his first three-point 20 shots, while in the first two quarters of the fourth game, the wizard giant continued to make three-point ironing, and missed all three points twice.

At the beginning of the third quarter, Bill knocked down Simmons on the offensive end, but on the second attack, bill immediately forced a three-point shot to finish his three-point shortage. However, bill seems to be a bit "top" because of this three-point shot. After that, he was obviously too excited at the offensive end and got the offensive foul again in less than 4 minutes.

Due to the injury of "the great" nbid, the ability of protecting the basket of the 76ers was significantly weakened, so bill also significantly increased the impact on the inside line in the attack.

A quick break after a steal, Bill assists eight inch dunk to score. After that, Bill scored another three points, a new three-point personal hit in this series, and then he broke through the layup. In the third quarter, Bill scored 10 points to help the Wizards expand the difference to more than 10 points. For bill, his only short board is the third quarter, he received three fouls in a single quarter.

When the 76ers reached the anti timeout in the last quarter, Bill made a pitching jump shot with 3 minutes left. With 45 seconds left, Bill broke through to the basket. He assisted eight inches and hit three points to help the Wizards win.
