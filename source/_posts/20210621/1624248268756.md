It was reported on June 21 that the 76ers lost 96-103 to the eagles in the eastern semi-final, and were eliminated 3-4. Ben Simmons made 2-for-4 shots, 0-3, 5 points, 8 rebounds and 13 assists.

Ben Simmons signed a five-year top salary contract with the 76ers in 2019, which is worth as much as $170 million. However, the players who have just signed a big contract in the League seem to be in a daze, and Simmons' performance and data have also declined. Since the playoffs this season, Simmons's performance has been greatly surprised, and he has also been a lot of criticism. In the first game of the first round against the wizards, although he got 15 points and 15 assists, he only contributed 6 points in 3 of 9 shots. Facing the hawks in the second round, Ben Simmons' shortcomings of insufficient free throw and free throw were magnified again. The Hawks used the tactics of "chopping down Ben". Many times, in the most critical last quarter, Simmons was targeted by the foul tactics, and then was pressed on the bench by the coach. In the first 11 games of the playoffs, the free throw percentage was 32.8%, ranking the second worst in history (Wallace was the first). Simmons' situation has become more embarrassing, after ESPN expert Zach Lowe said in a podcast program that Ben Simmons' poor performance in the playoffs has led to a decline in his trade value. Now, Simmons can only exchange CJ - mccollem level players.

After the start of the Seventh World War, Ben Simmons still didn't have much desire in personal projection. He only shot twice in the first half. Fortunately, the defensive side can bring help to the team, and the offensive side can sort out the team's attack. But the fatal thing is that he still doesn't shoot, and there are no three points in the outside line. Without three points, there is less than half of the threat. When the team is anxious, the 76ers can only count on enbid. Enbid, who was also a father and a mother, did not let the 76ers fall behind in the first half.

After entering the second half of the game, Simmons came up to assist Harris to score three points, and the 76ers overtook him. In 10:58, Simmons was blown for offensive fouls. This blow also made him give up his personal attack again and continue to indulge in sorting out the team's attack. In the key fourth quarter, Simmons didn't have a sense of existence most of the time, but manager rivers still kept him on the field. 1:49, Simmons successfully steals Trey - young, then the Hawks take foul tactics, Simmons 2 penalty 1. In the last 54 seconds, Simmons was put on the bench by the manager.
