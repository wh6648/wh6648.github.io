On June 21, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Philadelphia 76ers host the Eastern Conference semi-final with the Atlanta Hawks. At the end of the game, the Hawks beat the 76ers 103-96, eliminated their opponents 4-3, and entered the Eastern Conference finals six years later.

After many years of playoffs, the Philadelphia 76ers have never achieved anything. This time, they fell in the eastern semi-finals, and their opponent, the Hawks, turned out to be a "new army" whose core manager has never played in the playoffs.

Looking back at the 76 man series, many people think that the balance of victory and defeat was overturned in games 4 and 5. One theory is that with Philadelphia leading 2-1 and the G3 winning quite easily, some of them underestimated the enemy. This led to the team in the next two games were overturned, G4, they suffered 18 points reversal, and G5, they were reversed by 26 points.

However, rational analysis shows that there are deep-seated reasons why Philadelphia is inferior to the eagles. Philadelphia's lineup, in fact, has structural defects.

Everyone knows that nbid is the absolute core of Philadelphia's attack and defense. This season, emperor was selected as the best team and the best defensive team. In the early part of the regular season, when he was not injured, he was once the leader in the MVP list.

But at the end of the season, Emperor's injury made him fall behind in the MVP vote. More importantly, after the death of the great, Philadelphia's over dependence on the great began to appear.

This situation has become more prominent in the playoffs. When the game is stuck, when the situation is not good for Philadelphia, the 76ers will give the ball to Dadi. Dadi will be forced to attack and his physical strength will be greatly consumed. Different from some relatively easy nights in the regular season and semi-finals, he would dive at the end of almost every game.

Of course, if we insist on finding a scapegoat for Philadelphia's exit, this person will not be the great emperor, nor should he be the "king of reversals" coach rivers. Ben Simmons's bad free throw and his almost zero medium and long range projection are the key factors leading to Philadelphia's failure in this round.

Benxi's poor projection and free throw is no secret. However, in the past few years, he has never used off-season time to train and polish. Benxi, with a top salary contract, enjoys the pleasure of winning the regular season with confidence. He believes that his excellent physical fitness and excellent organization can solve most of the problems. But because of his defects, Philadelphia's playoffs have been dragged down again and again. Especially this season, his shortcomings have been magnified infinitely. When he encountered the opponent's "shark cutting tactics", his free throw was worse than O'Neill at that time.

So, back to the structural problem of the Philadelphia lineup, they have three best defensive players, but Simmons and Sebel, including Howard on the bench, have made very limited contributions on the offensive side. They also have a lot of players with good offensive talent, such as little curry, colkmaz, Milton, George Hill, but because of their weak physique, they are often misled by their opponents when defending.
