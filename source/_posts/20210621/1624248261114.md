On June 21, the NBA playoffs continued. In the eastern semi-final, the competition between the hawks and the 76ers entered the seven grabbing war. In the end, the 76ers lost 96-103 to the hawks and were eliminated 3-4. Nbid scored 31 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists in 11 of 21 shots.

The game started with extremely efficient performance. He scored 11 points in a single quarter, but in the following game, he encountered tight defense. He only scored one goal in the second quarter, and the attack efficiency plummeted sharply. In the third quarter, he only scored three points, and he missed Capella in a row on the defensive end, and was severely buckled by the latter. Although in the last quarter, enbid had three points, a Zhongtou and a singles team got nine points, but the efficiency was still not high. When he was 4 points behind in the last 40 seconds, the team was robbed and counterattacked by Gallinari. This fatal mistake almost ruined the hope of the 76ers, and the last three points were still not advanced. Although the data still looks good, but he is playing quite hard, the last crucial moment again fatal error is to blame.

Facing the Wizards in the first round of the playoffs, nbid was absolutely invincible. He was very efficient on both inside and outside. In the first game, he hit 12 free throws in 13 times. He was full of lethality on the inside and finally scored 30 points and 6 rebounds. In the second and third games, he was extremely efficient on the inside, making 16 of 22 shots in total. He was also very hot on the outside, making 3 of 4 shots outside the three-point line in both games, Especially in the third game, he scored 36 points. In the first three games, enbide averaged 29.3 points and 7 rebounds, with a shooting percentage of 67.4% and a three-point shooting percentage of more than 50%. It is in his no solution to play, the 76ers easily made a 3-0 big score lead.

However, in that good situation, nbid was suddenly hit in the fourth World War. He performed very well in the first quarter, got 8 points and 6 rebounds, and fell to the ground at the end of the first quarter. After confirmation, the pain in his right knee would not return, and the 76ers were pulled back by Qi Cai in the case of no leader. However, the 76ers finally rely on the advantage established by the team led by nbid to easily beat the Wizards 4-1 to advance to the second round.

In the second round, facing the Hawks led by Trey Yang, who entered the playoffs for the first time, the original strength of the 76 players was extremely difficult, which was directly related to the performance of enbid. In the first game, the fire line comeback performance of enbid was also quite excellent. He continued the hot state of blooming inside and outside in the first round on the field, and constantly attacked and killed. In addition, he also played inside singles, and had three points outside. He made 12 free throws, 15 free throws and 14 free throws, slashed 39 points, 9 rebounds and 4 assists, but the team lost unexpectedly.

In the second game, nbid further strengthened his offensive. He broke the Hawks' inside line with his own strength. In the whole game, he went to the free throw line 16 times and scored the highest 40 points in the playoffs. In addition, there were 13 rebounds. This game fully showed nbid's dominance in the inside line. If the Hawks defend alone, nbid is invincible. Because of this, in the following games, the Hawks began to strengthen the defense of enbid, and constantly carried out cooperative defense and entrapment, even more people.

In this way, enbid's efficiency has obviously fluctuated greatly. Although his data still looks good, in the next few games, enbid scored 27 points, quasi triple doubles, 17 points, 21 rebounds, 37 points, 13 rebounds and 22 points, 13 rebounds respectively. But in the fourth game, he only shot 4 for 20, and in the sixth game, he only shot 9 for 24,, What is more fatal is his continuous performance of spanning at the critical moment, which directly led to two key losses.

In the last 8.8 seconds, the 76ers struggled to catch up to just one point behind him. He hit a layup that was not very difficult, but unexpectedly didn't score. He missed a great chance to win and was tied by the eagles. In the fifth game, the same plot was staged again. In the last 10.9 seconds, the 76ers were 3 points behind. Enbid made a foul and got two key free throws. However, he lost two free throws and lost the chance for the 76ers to catch up with the score. The eagles completed a 26 point reversal and finally won the tianwangshan game to get the match point.

At the time of the sixth game of the series, enbid encountered a more fierce pinch defense. He made mistakes one after another from the beginning of the game. In the first half, only 4 out of 11 scored 8 points and 6 baskets, but he sent out 5 mistakes. Later, he was blocked and clashed fiercely. Although he still scored 22 points and 13 rebounds, he played very hard.

During the whole playoff period, nbid's performance was quite ups and downs. No one could stop him in the first round, but he was very difficult in the second round when he encountered fierce attacks. The fatal mistakes at three critical moments in succession were the direct backers for the team to lose the series.
