Chris Paul led the Phoenix Suns to the Western Conference finals after beating the nuggets of MVP joachi, which is Paul's second time in his career. Compared with his experience in the Western Conference of the Rockets in 2018, this one is more meaningful to Paul. Harden's rockets have a solid foundation. They made it to the Western Conference in 2015, and they advanced against Paul's clippers when they were 1-3 behind. Harden is the leader, Paul is the second leader, fans can't help saying harden brought Paul into the Western Conference. But this time the Suns promotion, Paul is the team controller, leading the "playoff virgin" Booker and Aton into the Western Conference, which reflects the value of Paul. We can't help but ask: as a point guard of historical level, Paul has top organization and vision, first-class defensive ability, steady shooting ability, and heart at the critical moment. Why is it so difficult to enter the Western Conference?

Paul is the representative of traditional point guards. Traditional point guards are different from modern point guards such as Ross, weishao or curry who focus on scoring. He takes organizing field control as the primary task, and is responsible for connecting the whole team, sorting out the attack, grasping the overall situation and driving team-mates to score. However, they have Achilles' heel. Most of them lack the scoring ability of chopping points and cutting vegetables, and rely on team-mates to score, The team will inevitably lose. So in history, the team with traditional point guard as the first core won very little, only magician, Thomas and Billups. Stockton, Nash and Deron failed to win, while Kidd and Rondo did not win as the first core.

Paul has a more tragic side, he entered the Western Conference too few times. He has played for the Hornets, clippers, rockets, thunder and Suns. During the rocket period, harden dragged Paul into the Western Conference; The team was too weak during the thunder. The period of wasp and clipper is one step away from the west, but why can't they break through after all? Where is the strong sun this year?

Hornets period, the team's competitiveness is poor (2009 playoffs meet Nuggets is to create a 58 point loss "miracle"). Only 2008 season is competitive, Paul is at his best and can compete for MVP with powerful Kobe Bryant¡° "Lethal scholar" David West and Paul play pick and roll, he can inside and outside, fire point wide; Peja and Peterson provided three-point firepower, chantler controlled the board to attack the basket and protect the basket, playing dirty work. There were gangsters Pago and Bonzi Wells on the bench. The coach Scott had excellent ability and could be said to be a strong man. The first round of the playoffs eliminated Dallas Mavericks, the second round met the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, the Hornets once made a 2-0 lead, the Western Conference is in sight. However, Popovich made a major lineup adjustment. Bowen no longer targeted Paul, but instead targeted Peja, who broke up three times, which became the turning point of the series. Peja scored 47 points in the first two games and 43 points in the last five games. In addition, G6 West was injured, and the team's scoring task fell on Paul. Paul was unable to swallow the bitter fruit of defeat.

During the Clippers period, Paul, Griffin and "Uncle Huang" Jordan made up the three giants to build a "city of empty contact". The team hoarded combat power and All-Star veterans. The lineup was gorgeous and competitive every year, but it was difficult to break through.

Negro has been in charge for two seasons, and his lineup can be five up and five down, but his record is not good: in 2012, his teammates include Billups, Caron Butler, Nicky young, Mo Williams, Kenyon Martin, foyer and bradso, but the team is seriously injured. In the first round of the playoffs, he played seven games with Grizzlies, Nicky young played super well, and Caron Butler came out with injuries, but the team was overdrawn, The second round was swept by the Spurs. In the 2013 season, teammates include Crawford, Barnes, Caron Butler, Billups, bradso, Odom, Turiaf, Grant Hill and Willie green. In the first round of the playoffs, grizzlies once took a 2-0 lead, but since then, Grizzlies have been playing steadily. Little corazolla has pulled little Jordan out of the high position, and Randolph has eaten Griffin raw from the low position, pulling the Clippers home for four games in a row, That's why Negro's class is over.

Rivers took over the Clippers coach, platoon arrangement and on-the-spot command to a higher level. In 2014, Griffin became the third scoring monster in the MVP, and Jordan found self-confidence. His teammates include JJ Roddick, Dudley, Barnes, Collins, Crawford, Willie green, Glenn Davis, Granger, tekoglu and Jamison. The team's fighting spirit is high. In the first round of the playoffs, the warriors were eliminated in seven games, but in the second round, the thunder was eliminated in six games. The 2015 season continued to be strong, with role players including JJ Reddick, Barnes, Crawford, little rivers, Joyce, Glenn Davis, and Turkoglu. In the first round of the playoffs, the defending champion spurs were knocked out 4-3. In the second round, when they were 3-1 ahead of the powerful rockets, the G5 clippers "tacitly" lost, and the G6 clippers once led by a big score. However, the Rockets put harden on the bench in the fourth quarter and took the three brothers Terry, Smith and brewer to attack. However, the Clippers lost power, playing like the Lotto team, and were knocked out by the Rockets. In the next two years, the Clippers suffered from injury crisis. In the 2016 season, Griffin and Paul were reimbursed, which was greatly reversed by lilard's pioneers; In the 2017 season, Griffin was eliminated by the jazz of Hayward because he was reimbursed midway through the playoffs.

Generally speaking, there are four problems in Paul's clipper period: first, the team is seriously injured; Second, the team defense has not been very good; Third, most of the players who have high expectations haven't played. The veteran is more famous than his strength and plays poorly. Crawford is a typical "regular season dragon, playoff worm"; Small front position has been the lack of good players, but the opponent often has a strong attack; What's more, Paul lacks explosive scoring power; Griffin's attack in the playoffs fell off the chain, especially in the fourth quarter because of poor physical performance and poor defense, which was often blown up by interior scorers such as Duncan and Randolph; Little Jordan only has the ability to attack the basket and has no other scoring means, which makes the opponent's defense focus on Griffin and Paul. That limits the future of the team.

Compared with the Hornets and Clippers, this season's Suns have many advantages. The team has Booker, a super scorer who can play hard games. He can carry the team's basic points and have strong key points. Paul will take over the game when necessary. The Suns don't need Paul to carry the basic score and cut the key score, which is what the Hornets clippers didn't have.

In the playoffs, Aton's ability to pick and roll down and attack the basket has been upgraded, and his ability to defend and protect the basket has evolved. Penn has evolved into a good rotation in the playoffs, sharing a lot when Paul is injured. Claude and bridges have solid three points, strong style of play and good defensive skills. The disadvantage of the sun's configuration is that Saric or Kaminsky, who are ordinary in strength, are the substitutes. Fortunately, Aton is still young and can carry it.

The sun's idea of building the team is not like the Clippers' hoarding of veteran players who are eager for quick success and instant benefits, but to take the younger route, so the sun does not have the Clippers' injury and aging problems; However, the draft ability is worrying, and has gone a lot of detours. Fortunately, Booker and Aton have already made a small success after training. They almost made it into the playoffs after eight consecutive wins in the playoffs last season. What the team lacks is a highly respected leader, so Paul is here.

Monty coach in the Hornets during a short period of coaching Paul, quite a source. Because the team lacks the ability to attack the basket, Monty created the pick and roll space basketball, focusing on positional warfare to ensure the success rate. Paul, Booker and Penn can all be pick and roll players. These three players have good ability to call the inside line. Eaton is the pick and roll wall, and Claude, bridges and Johnson are the three point shooters. The defensive end relies on Aton, Paul, Claude and bridges to build a solid defense.

Monty playoff arrangements Paul, Booker and Penn, etc. for the opponent's interior roll call, Aton is the next score. After Paul's shoulder injury, Monty decided to use Payne, which not only gave Paul enough time to recover from the injury, but also trained new people. Playoff opponents of the Lakers and nuggets both have big centers. Gasol Jr. of the Lakers was called down and Zhuang Shen barely supported him. However, the son of the Lakers, Nongmei, restrained the Suns' roll call attack; With the injury of thick eyebrow, the attack and defense missed a link, the Lakers immediately lost, was ruthlessly eliminated. Nuggets star is center joachi, himself afraid of roll call, second leader Murray injured, joachi cut points no matter how strong, can not do with the sun for points, so Nuggets was swept. Monty showed top-notch platoon deployment and on-the-spot command ability, much better than Scott and Negro, and slightly better than rivers. It's all a guarantee for the Suns to advance.
