On June 16, the Brooklyn nets held the home court to welcome the fifth game of the eastern semi-final with Milwaukee Bucks, which is also known as the battle of Tianwang mountain. At the end of the game, the nets narrowly beat the Bucks 114-108, leading 3-2 in the series.

In this battle, Durant presented an epic performance. He shouldered the team by himself. He contributed 49 points, scored 10 assists, 17 rebounds, 3 steals and 2 blocks. In the last quarter, he led the team to surpass by 20 points and defeated the opponent by one. What's more amazing is that KD didn't stop for a minute and played for 48 minutes.

Among them, Durant shot 10 of 13 in the second half, 3 of 5 out of 3, and scored 31 points with 8 of 9 free throws. It's the second time in Durant's career that he scored 30 + in the playoffs. It's also the first player in the history of the nets in nearly 25 years.

But at the last moment, Durant only scored one of the two free throws and missed the chance to level his career playoff single game scoring record (50 points). In the end, his whole game score was fixed at 49 points, which was also his second high score in his career playoff single game.
