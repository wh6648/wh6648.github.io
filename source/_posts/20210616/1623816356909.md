On June 16, after Boston Celtics were eliminated in the first round, general manager Denny Angie announced his retirement, and Brad Stevens took over the position of general manager. There is no doubt that Celtic will be in this off-season lineup adjustment, in order to improve the overall strength of the team. However, due to the NBA's salary cap, Celtic has limited options in the free agent market. Reporter Brian Robb today wrote about some potential candidates who meet Celtic's requirements, including Memphis Grizzlies forward Kyle Anderson.

"Kyle Anderson's contract will expire in the summer of 2022 with a salary of $9.93 million. League sources revealed that Celtic have been following Anderson for some time. Grizzlies have a lot of young talent on the flank, and they may choose to use the 27 year old winger to get some assets back when he enters his contract year. Anderson's progress as a three-point shooter last season, coupled with his passing ability, makes him very suitable for Boston. He will provide all his skills for this team Brian Robb wrote.

Anderson has played 69 games for Grizzlies this season, averaging 12.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists.
