On June 16, the NBA playoffs continued. Bucks lost 108-114 to the nets, 2-3 behind in the series.

This game, the letter brother 22 shot 14, won 34 points 12 rebounds 4 assists, including the first three quarters of 16 in 11, the last section of 6 in 3, but failed to help the Bucks win the Tianwang mountain.

After the start of the game, brother Letterman was more cautious about the attack. He didn't insist on shooting the three points that the nets gave him. He used his own impact to help his teammates create opportunities. As soon as he came up, he sang a duet with Middleton, assisted Middleton to make a layup, then rebounded and hit his best shot.

In addition to personal attack, Letterman reduced his time as the initiator on the offensive end. He became more of a pick and roll player. He used his own impact advantage to create a lot of shooting opportunities for his teammates, including the hand-in-hand after holding the ball at the upper limit. He had a great defensive attack on the net, and also made the Bucks gain a huge lead in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, the letter brother insisted on the offensive strategy in the first quarter. After returning to the field, he did not attack without brain. He continued to use pick and roll to create opportunities for Middleton and holliday. In the middle of the second quarter, Letterman made his first three-point shot and hit. This three-point also opened letterman's personal attack mode, followed by a middle distance hit. When the letter brother can hit these long-range shots, the defense of the net will be extremely severe test.

The letter brother's performance is not over. On the defensive side, he used his terrible defensive area to become the Bucks' basket guard after Lopez came off the court. He continuously blocked the ball, then pushed up the counterattack, and killed the basket in one stop. The defense led the attack. One person even scored 7 points to open the difference again.

Yi Bian fought again, the nets strengthened the no ball defense of the letter brother, and the letter brother did not have too much personal desire to attack, still carrying out the strategy of not holding the ball. But in the first half of the third quarter, the letter brother did not participate in the attack too much, which led to his containment was not played out, the nets also took the opportunity to close the score.

It wasn't until four and a half minutes left in the third quarter that Letterman got the first point in the second half through a free throw. Then he started his personal attack mode, first hit the basket, and then hit the three-point in the key stage of the rebound. Then he forced to kill under the basket and caused additional punishment, which helped the bucks to stabilize the situation.
