On June 16, the NBA officially announced its best team of the season.

The Ten Lost Pearls also came into being

1. Russell Westbrook

This season, Wei Shao once again provided a high-energy output of three doubles per game, with an average contribution of 22.2 points, 11.5 points, 11.7 assists, 1.4 steals, a shooting percentage of 43.9%, a three-point shooting percentage of 31.5% and a free throw percentage of 65.5%. And in the history of triple double top, but also because of his strong power in the late season, the wizard was able to catch the bus at the end of the playoffs. Unfortunately, in the selection of the best team, Wei Shao was ignored. However, it is worth mentioning that of all the defenders who lost the election, Wei Shao got the most votes.

2. Jason Tatum

This season, Tatum averaged 26.4 points, 7.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game, and scored a new career high. For the first time, Tatum entered the 25 + club. Today, Tatum is the undisputed leader of the green shirt, and is also recognized as the first-line scorer in the league. However, after losing the best team, the starting salary of Tatum and the green army can only stay at $163 million in five years, which fails to activate the additional terms in the contract.

3. Kevin Durant

Kevin - Durant's ability is beyond reproach, this season, after his comeback, play also basically maintained the condition before the injury. He averaged 26.9 points, 7.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, shooting 53.7%, three-point 45% and free throw 88.2%. Even in the big three nets, KD is still the most reliable attacker. The only problem is that Durant has only played 35 times this season, which has become the main reason why he failed to win the best team.

4. James Harden

This season, after turning from the rocket to the shooting net, James Harden once played a fantastic game. At the end of the season, he averaged 24.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 10.8 assists, and the data is still considerable. However, it should be pointed out that because of the hamstring injury, harden started the recovery mode later this season, and the absenteeism rate increased sharply. In the whole regular season, he only played 44 games, which made him lose the chance to enter the best team.

5. Zion Williamson

This season, the second year's Zion - Williamson has secured the pelican core position, although, at the end of the season, he suffered a left ring finger fracture, and the pelican also missed the playoffs. But in 61 games for pelicans, panghu averaged 33.2 minutes, got 27 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.9 steals, 0.6 blocks and 61.1% shooting percentage. He became the first player after Kevin McHale in 1986-87 season to average at least 25 points and hit more than 60%. More importantly, he still has great potential to explore.

6. German Booker

This season, Booker is getting better with the progress of the schedule. In the regular season, Booker averaged 25.6 points, 4.3 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game, which was lower than last season. However, his health and efficiency were better than last year. In terms of results, Booker is also not bad. Under his leadership, the sun came second in the West. Maybe the only reason for Booker's failure is that his style is a little low-key. But after watching Booker play in the first two rounds of the playoffs, I believe many voters have regretted their choice.

7. Zach Raven

This past season, for Laven, is the most breakthrough season in his career. In the regular season, he played 58 games, with an average score of 27.4 points. After seven years of hard work, Laven has finally become one of the top scorers recognized by the whole league. In addition to scoring, raven averaged 4.9 assists per game, which is also a career high. His average three-point shooting rate is the first time to break through the 40% mark. However, the Bulls' relatively poor record has lowered Raven's vote and made him a legacy of the best team.

8. Donovan Mitchell

Mitchell's performance is also not much to blame. In the regular season, he averaged 26.4 points, 5.2 assists, and the three-point shooting rate reached 38.6%. All the three data are career highs. Under his leadership, the Jazz won the best record in the regular season of the whole league. However, his excellent performance was ignored by the vote of the best team, The phenomenon of seniority is quite serious.

9. Trey young

Also because of the lack of qualifications, was excluded from the best lineup list, there are hawks core Trey - young. Undeniably, this season, blowing Yang experienced a lost stage. But in the middle of the season, with the Hawks changing coach, Yang also found the inspiration to lead the team. The whole season down, he averaged 25.3 points, lower than last season, but he averaged 9.43 assists is a career high. Finally, the Hawks ranked fifth in the East, back to the playoffs, Yang is also a great credit.

10. BAM Adebayor
