On June 16, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Brooklyn nets at home ushered in the Milwaukee Bucks with the eastern semi-final Game 5, which is commonly known as the battle of the kings. At the end of the game, the nets narrowly beat the Bucks 114-108, leading 3-2 in the series.

This battle, James - harden takes an injury to go out to fight, but the condition is not qualified, he only obtains 5 points 6 backboards 8 assists.

After updating the injury report several times, harden finally made his debut in the most crucial battle of Mount Tianwang.

However, from the constantly changing information, we can clearly feel the hesitation of the nets coaching team, nets management or harden himself.

There is a reason for people's hesitation. After the comeback, harden did not show a healthy attitude. First quarter up, harden is very cautious, he hardly a forced breakthrough, most of the time, are dodging floating in the outside line. Obviously, the hamstring injury, let harden dare not open the pace to the interior impact.

Teammates are also very clear about harden's situation, therefore, most of the time, as long as harden holds the ball, other people will try their best to pick and roll with him, give him cover, and try to create offensive space for him.

However, on the stage of the semi-finals of the playoffs, especially on the night of fighting to the death in the battle of Mount Tianwang, harden can't be relaxed or have too many opportunities to adjust.

As a result, in the whole first half, he was always in such a difficult situation, not only attacking, but also defending. He was also subject to injuries, and even once became a weakness of the opponent. This situation, can not help but remind people of those bad postseason memories about harden, although, this time, injuries can be the reason for harden's depression, but the game is no reason to find.

Half time, the net has been suppressed, and until the third quarter more than 7 minutes, harden finally single Middleton, playing 2 + 1, finally activated the scoring account.

It can be said that in the most exciting moment of the game, Jeff Green and Durant propped up the net attack. And the only thing harden can do is to do some tactical containment at the offensive end.

At the end of the game, harden's containment played a role in the end. Although, his condition is very bad, but as long as he stands on the field, the Bucks do not dare to attack Durant so recklessly. At the end of the game, as KD opened the death mode, the balance of the game gradually fell to the side of the net.
