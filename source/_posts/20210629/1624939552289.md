On June 29, the list of 12 men's basketball players in the Tokyo Olympic Games has been announced, including Durant, BAM Adebayor, bill, Devon Booker, Jeremy grant, Raymond Green, Zhu hollerdy, raven, lilard, lefo, Middleton and Tatum. The appearance of lefo surprised many people.

Lok Fu won the gold medal with the U.S. team in 2012 Olympic Games, but did not participate in the Olympic Games in 2016, and has been struggling in the NBA in the past few years.

In the past three seasons, lefo has only played 103 games, while in this period, he averaged only 16.2 points per game. Lok Fu has not been an all star since 2018. Even at his peak, Loew's defense has always been a weakness.

There is no lack of capable big men to choose from in the United States, such as Randall of the Knicks. Executive director of the U.S. men's basketball team Colangelo said Randall was close to being selected into the U.S. men's basketball team, but there were two reasons why he chose Lefu in the end.

"One is his experience in international competitions," said Colangelo. "Yes, although he hasn't played much in the past few years, his versatility is very valuable in the front court, which is the second reason to choose him."

In addition to the London Olympics, Lok Fu was also selected by the U.S. team for the 2010 World Cup, which won the gold medal in Turkey. Lok Fu averaged 8.5 points and 6.2 rebounds in 17 international games, all of which emphasized big man's shooting and passing. These are the abilities of Lok Fook. He is one of the best passers, hitting 38.7% of the three-point shots at the Olympics and the world cup.
