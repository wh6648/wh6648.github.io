On June 29, the eagles officially announced that star Trey young had a bone bruise on his right foot and that the G4's status in the Eastern Conference finals was doubtful.

Yang was injured in the G3 on Monday. At the end of the third quarter, Yang stepped on the referee behind him after passing a ball and sprained his right ankle. Out of caution, Yang, accompanied by the staff, returned to the dressing room for examination and treatment, then returned to the court and played the game.

"It was a strange accident. I didn't see him at that time," Yang said after the match. "I think I have to pay attention to the people behind me now. Of course, injuries are also a very important part of the game

G3 in the case of injury, Yang's performance is still excellent, handing over 35 points, 4 assists and 1 steals.

Today's MRI results show that Yang's right foot has a bone bruise, and G4 is suspected to play, that is, there is a 50% possibility of playing.

"He's feeling ok now, just disappointed with the G3 defeat," hawks coach Nate McMillan said. "It's the playoffs, and most people will have injuries or pain. Today you need to take care of your body and be ready for tomorrow's game

Yang is the eagles' biggest contribution to the Eastern Conference finals this year. Since the playoffs, he has scored 29.8 points, 2.7 rebounds, 9.5 assists and 1.3 steals in 15 games.
