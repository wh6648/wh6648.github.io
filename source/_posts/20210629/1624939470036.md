Although there is still more than a month to go before the off-season really starts, it is obvious that rumors have been flying all over the place for a long time. Preliminary judgment, this summer, the alliance may be a large area of mobility. Among them, some of the team's leading stars are faced with the choice of changing teams.

1. Carl Anthony Downes

This past season, for Downes, is still extremely tortuous. Although, with the passage of time, he gradually out of the shadow of the pain of his mother's death, but, in the lead, Downes is still helpless. Throughout the season, Downes played 50 times, continuing the low attendance rate of the previous season, and affected by the wrist injury, he was unable to do the whole season full of form and attack with all his strength.

If you say that in previous years, off-season, wolves can rest assured to let Downes recuperate, looking forward to his comeback in the new season, but this time, the situation seems to be different. After another season in the Western Countdown with only 30% win rate, Downes may have moved the idea of leaving. Although, Downes has been accused of soft playing style, although his contract still has more than $100 million in three years. As an inside player whose style matches the current basketball trend, as a 25-year-old general who is still in his first year of playing, his value in the trading market is quite considerable.

2. Zach Raven

This past season, for Laven, is the most breakthrough season in his career. In the regular season, he played 58 games, with an average score of 27.4 points. After seven years of hard work, Laven has finally become one of the top scorers recognized by the whole league. In addition to scoring, raven averaged 4.9 assists per game, which is also a career high. His average three-point shooting rate is the first time to break through the 40% mark.

In addition, raven was selected into the all star game for the first time in his career, and in order to help Raven impact the playoffs, the Bulls started a big deal in the middle of the season, poaching the magic core Nicolas vucevich. But, unfortunately, the Bulls' efforts failed to help them get a playoff ticket. At the end of the season, it came out that Raven sold his house at a loss. That is to say, although raven is qualified to renew his contract with the bulls in advance, he may not want to stay in Chicago this summer. For such a rare attacking genius, how can the Bulls persuade and retain him in the off-season?

3. Damian Lillard

Since he entered the NBA in 2012, lilard has been playing as a pioneer. He has gradually grown into the core of the team and has become a rare representative of "one person, one city" in the active NBA players. But this off-season, it seems that Lillard is really likely to leave.

First of all, after being out of the playoffs, Lillard sent a meaningful message on social media, which he wrote, "how long do I have to give? When will the opportunity come? " Lillard's words quickly aroused people's heated discussion. Then, in the process of selecting the Blazers' coach, Lillard was involved in the storm again. Some fans accused him of blindly endorsing the new coach Billups. Some of the accusations even came from Lillard's loyal fans, which made him very cold. In addition, the pioneer's management is not enterprising, and the operation thinking of changing the soup without changing the dressing has also caused the dissatisfaction of Li's guidance. It is reported that Lillard and James have eaten twice in the off-season. These undoubtedly increase the possibility of his leaving Portland.

4. Bradley bill

It's also a secret of the whole league that bill is leaving the wizard. In fact, in the past few years, every off-season, bill has been the subject of all kinds of transfer rumors. This season, the wizard sent away wall and equipped bill with a new partner - Westbrook. However, Wei Shao's data brush is happy, but his ability to lead the team has been questioned. Although the wizard got on the last bus of the playoffs, he was out of the game in a round. As for bill himself, he didn't have much to boast about in a year, except that he almost won the scoring champion of the season.

At the end of the season, the Wizards fired coach Scott Brooks, and Bill didn't talk about his future in an interview. Obviously, he himself knows that in the off-season, there will be a new wave of soap operas on his way.

5. Coway Leonard

This season, all goes well in the regular season. When he comes to the playoffs, he starts the average 30 + mode, and his personal score comes to 30.4 points. What's amazing is that after 11 playoffs, his shooting percentage reaches an amazing 57.3%. However, just as the title process is going smoothly, in the semi-final of the battle of Tianwang mountain, Xiao Ka suddenly injured the cruciate ligament of his knee and suspended his exemption card.

To make matters worse, the latest tip shows that there is a conflict between Carlos and the clippers, because the Clippers medical team underestimated the impact of Carlos' knee injury, and Carlos is extremely dissatisfied with it. Now, the small card in the playoffs is not likely to come back, and the clippers have been in the edge of the season out. Once the Clippers are eliminated, it is uncertain whether he will continue to stay in the clippers, taking into account the possibility that he will become a free agent this summer.

6. Zion Williamson

Although he didn't have much success in leading the team, in the first two seasons of his career, Zion showed his talent in pelicans, and he was selected into the all star team. In the 61 games of the season, he averaged 27 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.9 steals, 0.6 blocks and 61.1% shooting percentage. He became the first player after Kevin McHale in 1986-87 who averaged at least 25 points and hit more than 60%.
