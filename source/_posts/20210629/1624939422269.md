On June 29, it was reported that the fifth game between the clippers and the suns in the NBA playoffs Western Conference finals started today. The Clippers star Paul George played the role of a superhero again without a way out. He shot 15 of 20, scored 41 points, 13 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals, leading the Clippers to beat the Suns 116-102 away and chase the total score of the series to 2-3.

At the beginning of the first quarter, Reggie and Morris were in excellent condition at the beginning. George took the initiative to give up the ball and put more energy on the defensive end. Three minutes later, he made a 2 + 1 layup in the attack defense transition. In the middle of this section, George was careless in handling the ball and was replaced after two mistakes in a row. At the end of the first quarter, the clippers were 10 points ahead of the suns.

Entering the second quarter, George once again seized the opportunity to lay up successfully in the conversion attack. Seeing that the other side's chasing point momentum was very fierce, George stepped forward to pick Booker's difficult basket successfully, and then he took a tough fight against bridge's step back jump shot. In the face of Booker's close defense, George used his weight advantage to hit the inside line, and after half-time, the Clippers took a 59-52 lead over the suns.

The other side fight again, George finally opened the personal attack mode, he forced Eaton to make a layup and then jumped to fight Claude to throw a 2 + 1 to help the Clippers hold the lead. After that, George was out of control. After four points, he dribbled the ball behind the right wing and knocked Paul down. He was more resolute when he found his hand on the outside line. He hit three goals in a row in the long-distance jump shot and scored 20 points in a single quarter, leading the Clippers to expand their advantage to 13 points at the end of the three quarters.

In the last quarter, when George was resting off the court, the Clippers' attack suddenly stagnated and was hit by the sun to narrow the difference. After that, George didn't make a difference when he came back on the court. He forced the basket to lay up, but was dissatisfied that the referee didn't call a foul. Since then, he showed a little emotional imbalance, two consecutive mistakes, rebounding was also called foul. Fortunately, he calmed down in time and stopped the decline in the attack defense conversion.
