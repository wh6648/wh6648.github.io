On June 29, the Suns lost 102-116 to the fast fleet at home. Devon Booker made 9-for-22 shots, 4-for-6 three-point shots and 9-for-11 free throws in 43 minutes, contributing 31 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals. The positive and negative value on the court was - 10.

As a result of wearing a mask, Booker's performance at the offensive end was greatly affected, so he took off the mask immediately after missing a layup in the third quarter of the fourth game of the series. However, Booker said in an interview that after he took off his mask, he was beaten in the face many times. So today's game, Booker put on the mask again to protect his injured nose.

After the start of the game, Booker made the first shot out of the basket, but quickly adjusted to finish the line with Paul and scored three points. When the Suns got into trouble, Booker immediately stood up. First, George fouled the outside defense and made three free throws. After a few rounds, Booker made a contribution on the outside line again. Despite 11 points in a single quarter, the Suns were still 10 points behind the Clippers at the end of the first quarter. After entering the second quarter of the game, Booker is still the most stable performance of the suns. The most wonderful scene happened in the last 3.1 seconds of the festival. In the last attack of the first half, after Burke destroyed Reggie Jackson's shot, Paul served from the backcourt sideline. After Aton received the ball, he quickly distributed the ball to Burke from the outside. Burke shook Reggie Jackson's defense and hit the three-point whistle after adjustment.

After entering the second half of the game, Booker's offensive efficiency began to decline, and he was even fouled in 6 minutes and 17 seconds. Only one goal was scored in the third quarter. However, in the key fourth quarter, Booker began to show his strength, scoring three goals in a short 39 seconds. But after 8 minutes, Booker didn't get a point. One minute and 14 seconds before the end of the game, Booker left the court and the sun disarmed ahead of time.
