March 15 the NBA regular season continues today, with the Clippers challenging pelicans away. The Clippers star Paul George continued the downturn of the recent period of time, only 5 of the 14 shots in the game, including 1 in 8 of 3 points, 15 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 4 errors, the positive and negative value was only pitiful - 24, the Clippers collapsed in the end, 115-135 defeat Pelican away.

At the beginning of the first quarter, George didn't have a strong desire to attack until 7:30 when he hit the first goal of the game with three points under the cover. However, he ended up playing iron with three points in the back step of the opponent's interior line in the next two times. In addition, he made two mistakes in succession and was soon replaced for rest. At the end of the first quarter, the clippers were 12 points behind the pelicans.

Entering the second quarter, George made two stops in succession, but he still couldn't find his hand outside the three-point line, and he couldn't grasp the opportunity for the vacant three-point. At the end of the festival, George got his third foul and had to be replaced. After half-time, the clippers were 57-67 behind pelicans.

The other side fought again, George continued to feel cold outside the three-point line. After two empty three-point failures, he had to rely on the difficult backward jump shot to stop the bleeding for the team. But after that, he tried to break through the points and led his teammates to make mistakes. The Clippers also completely lost their confidence and both ends of attack and defense were blasted by their opponents. At the end of the third quarter, the Clippers are 27 points behind.
