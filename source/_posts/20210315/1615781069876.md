March 15 news, the new coronavirus is still rampant in the United States, but with the decrease of new confirmed cases in California, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James hopes fans can return to Staples Center as soon as possible.

Several teams in the NBA League have allowed a certain number of fans to return to the stadium, including the Phoenix Suns, Utah Jazz and Milwaukee Bucks. However, the California team still insists on their epidemic prevention agreement and does not open the door to the fans. At present, the Lakers, clippers, kings and warriors do not allow fans to enter their venues. However, as the epidemic in California is easing, James hopes to allow some fans to enter the stadium to watch the game.

"I've watched a lot of games recently, with 1500 to 2000 fans. It's going to give you extra motivation, and I'm just waiting - hopefully as soon as possible - for us to have fans in California, especially at Staples Center, and I hope as soon as possible, it's going to help us and our fans a lot James said in an interview.

Teams in the league are still affected by health and safety agreements, which cause players to miss games and postpone games because of detection and close contact tracking mechanisms. Recently, due to health and safety problems, the Lakers lack Dennis Schroeder and mark Gasol. Schroeder even publicly criticized the league's decision to deal with his four game absence. For now, the NBA teams in California have not been informed that they can allow fans to enter, although many places have been transferred to the red level.

This season is the 18th year of James' career, and his performance is still strong, which makes the fans marvel. James has done everything you can think of in this league - winning the championship, being an all star, competing for MVP and so on. However, for James, it is the young people who have given him the motivation to play this season.

"At the end of the day, there are still some kids out there watching me," James said. "They're watching the way I play. They'll see if I'm tired? Are I satisfied? And things like that. Anyway, I don't want to give them excuses. What you need to do is to step on the field and give your life to the game, because the game will give you everything back. I understand that when I play, I have a responsibility to go beyond myself
