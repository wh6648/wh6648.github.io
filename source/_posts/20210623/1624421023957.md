The 76ers of Philadelphia, the first place in the East, were knocked out by the Atlanta Hawks, and they were once again stigmatized. Self funded City 76 people formed the "double emperor" combination of Ben Simmons and enbid, which seems to be hot, but the playoffs are disappointing every year. In an interview with the media after the game, enby said with dismay: "the turning point of the game is that it is clear that we have an open chance, but it only turns into one out of two free throws." The original G7 had 3:30 seconds left in the fourth quarter, and the 76ers were only two points behind the Hawks. Ben Simmons didn't get an empty basket, but made a foul on his teammates. In the end, one of the two free throws failed to pull the score. Coach rivers bluntly said: "Simmons free throw is too bad, is a factor in the loss." All the spearheads are directed at Ben Simmons, who lost the chain in the playoffs. For a moment, the Philadelphia darling changed from "sweetie" to "Mrs. bull", and the internal problems of Philadelphia became apparent.

Simmons is very popular in the United States because of his handsome face and has top traffic; Coupled with his "all-around" playing style, the regular season performance always let the team hold expectations, general manager brand said publicly last season: "only Simmons is not for sale." Philadelphia missed a lot of good luck works because of Simmons: for example, in the summer of 2018, Philadelphia wanted to trade Leonard, who fell out with the Spurs, but failed because the Spurs asked for one of Simmons or enbid. Leonard was finally traded to the Raptors and led the team to win the first championship in the history of the Raptors. In the 2019 season, Butler came to Philadelphia to fight seven games with the champion raptors; However, because Simmons didn't want to play without the ball, Philadelphia didn't renew Butler's contract (Fox Sports Reporter Yaron Weitzman recently reported). Butler joined the heat in the summer and led the team to the finals in 2020. In 2021 season, Philadelphia and the Rockets discussed the deal of harden. The Rockets asked for chips from Simmons, rookie Maxi and three first round signings. After Philadelphia refused, harden finally went to the nets to build a powerful three. It is not difficult to see that Simmons' expected value is seriously overestimated by the management of Philadelphia. If Philadelphia wins Leonard, butler or harden, it will have at least one champion.

Romantic Simmons is still the all-round "ah Dou", he can break through, back, grab the board, organize, push fast attack, pass the ball with good vision, top defense and wide coverage; But Simmons can't shoot, just like Benxi Iron and steel, dare not shoot when there is a vacancy, occasionally he can shoot a three-point to make the basketball news. Kobe Bryant once tried to persuade Simmons to practice shooting, but Simmons was either not interested in shooting training, or really possessed a devil. So far, he hasn't practiced it. (editor's note: as a contrast, fultz suffered from neurotic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS, which was suspected to be Yi Pu disease) and affected his shooting feel. He once finished 150000 hard practice shots in the off-season to find his hand, Although the hit rate is still not good, but the spirit is good, not lazy Simmons can compare. Simmons's play is very popular in the regular season, because the opponent can't always aim at him. He played very well. He once won three sets, twice one defense. But in the playoffs, shooting short board will be targeted by opponents, defects will be magnified, coupled with poor psychological quality, the final performance plummeted, leading to team defeat. Since the playoffs of 2018 season, the Celtic's young coach let him shoot and cut off the connection between him and his teammates. Simmons didn't know what to do. Philadelphia was eliminated 4-1 by Celtic. All in all, Simmons locked up the upper limit of Philadelphia.

Philadelphia 76ers this season to the lineup, the introduction of Murray as president of basketball operations, fired coach brown, the introduction of rivers (general manager brand may have been overhead). This is a team that attaches great importance to data analysis. In recent years, it has invested about US $3 million a year (former general manager Xinji is an expert in data analysis). The team created a new lineup according to the concept of digitalization. For this reason, it cleaned up hofford who compressed the offensive space, in exchange for Denny green and Seth curry who could open the space, and also introduced Howard, the substitute of enbid, to change the double tower playing method to one big four small, so as to create a modern space basketball.

Rivers took Simmons and still danced in chains, but he did find a solution. He let Simmons reduce the proportion of attack and put more energy on organization, fast attack and defense; Enbid strengthened the attack, played the MVP level. Under the leadership of ShuangDi, the team's defense was promoted to the second place in the league, and the defense efficiency was as high as 107; The attack efficiency is 112.5, which is the 13th in the league; The regular season record East first, looks very beautiful, even the first round to win the Washington Wizards do not see any problem!

But the emperor's new clothes were torn by the hawks in the second round of the playoffs. The eagles fell out of the top eight for a time this season. After firing former manager pierce and replacing him with McMillan, the team made great progress and scored the fifth in the East. The Hawks are an attacking team that plays pick and roll. Trey young is a top scorer and has a first-class passing vision; Luwei, Bogdan and Holt can output external firepower, Collins can output internal firepower and external firepower, and Capella can cut points. The attack efficiency is 114.3, the ninth in the league. The team is short of strong defensive players, weak defense, low defense efficiency of 112.1, 18th in the league, good at defense of redish and hunt have been injured, not to play is even worse.

But this Hawk has pulled the top of the East into the abyss. The offensive end of the team insists on two points: Yang holds the ball to pick and roll, punishes the opponent's Center (nbid and Howard) by name, either shoots himself, or pushes his teammates to follow (Capella and Collins) or shoots outside (Collins); Teammates open space to catch the ball and shoot. The Hawks attach importance to early offense. Before the Philadelphia formation is formed, they are not stable and avoid unnecessary physical confrontation. Because enbid and Howard have the common defect of the big center, Philadelphia is forced to use the way of squeeze cover or clip to avoid injury, but the effect is very little. When Philadelphia adopted an early or unlimited forward defense change, when Simmons or Sebel played Yang, Yang increased his early attack and long-range three points. Yang slashed 29 points and 10.9 assists in this round, with a three-point shooting rate of only 32.3%. However, he has a high output and is hard to parry.

Philadelphia is in a passive situation. If enbid can change points, it's a pity that I can't. Although he can play inside and outside, he can carry the basket, face the basket, and throw the ball suddenly, it's a pity that his passing coordination is not so good, and he doesn't have enough energy in the fourth quarter. The team organization task falls on Simmons, but Simmons can't shoot, stand three-point line will be put, stand inside line is a threat, but blocked the offensive space of enbid; After a foul, the free throw was not allowed. Over time, the mentality collapsed, and it seemed to enter a state of self denial. The performance was low. In this round, the average score was only 9.9 points, and the free throw hit rate was as low as 33.3%. After Denny green was injured, the team lost a heavyweight shooter. Colkmaz (the playoff downturn), Sebel and Maxi could not open the space, so they relied on ceskuli and Harris to open the space. The offensive space was blocked to the extreme, and the team relied too much on enbid's single swing, so the Hawks gave him confrontation, upper packet and regional joint defense, pinching the internal and external connections. In the end, although enbid averaged 30.4 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, his physical ability collapsed in the fourth quarter and he couldn't move (the shooting rate dropped from 47% to 39%). In fact, the Hawks defense is not good, but the targeted layout does hold the opponent.

History always repeats itself. Veteran Howard revisits the magic scene of the 2011 season when he faced the eagles led by Joe Johnson in the first round. Hawks coach drew hoarded a bunch of meat shield players to fight against him in a wheel fight, strangling his teammates. When his physical fitness collapsed in the fourth quarter, his teammates couldn't hold up the situation when he let go of his singles, and hawks took the magic lightly.
