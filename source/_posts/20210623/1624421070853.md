On June 23, it was reported that the Bucks were about to win the eastern championship, and all eyes would focus on Milwaukee. However, some citizens and businesses were worried about the increase of violence in the city center.

"Fighting, drunk driving, a lot of people running red lights, shooting." This is a description of what a man who owns an apartment near water street saw and heard over the weekend. The man, who declined to be named, said he was fed up with the rising crime rate in the area and wrote a letter to the mayor and the fire police Council, but received no response.

"I just want to see a detailed plan, not just water street, but the whole city, because the crime rate has reached the extreme these days." The man said.

Over the past weekend, there have been two shootings and several fights in the city centre. Police issued eight municipal tickets, 62 traffic tickets and towed 42 vehicles.

"The Milwaukee police department is ready to work with the Milwaukee Bucks, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's office, the Milwaukee fire department, the Milwaukee health department and the Department of public works to provide a safe and reliable environment for the deer district. During the playoffs, the Milwaukee police department will provide additional resources, including unrestricted motorcycles, dangerous devices, K9 and mounted police. Milwaukee police shared the excitement of playoff basketball, but criminal activity is intolerable. The Milwaukee police department wishes the Milwaukee Bucks good luck in their fight for the championship Milwaukee police said in a statement.

In addition, mayor Barrett said he was working with city leaders and had a conversation with acting police chief Jeffrey Norman on Monday night local time¡° I understand and agree that we should have more police concerns, and we are trying to do the same. " Mayor Barrett said.

According to media reports, the police were told not to take high handed measures and worried that it would affect the police's ability to effectively enforce the law¡° I hope our police can be fair and just. I don't want them to take tough measures to create problems and lead to mass demonstrations. " Mayor Barrett said.

Some companies will change their working hours until the situation is under control. The manager of a pizza shop said they would close at midnight on weekends instead of 3 a.m., because the safety of employees and customers was the top priority.
