June 23, 2021 NBA draft lottery draw ceremony online. In the end, the pistons won the number one spot, the Rockets won the top spot, and the Cavaliers won the exploratory spot.

This year's draft draw, the continuation of last year's rules, ranking the last three rockets, pistons and magic draw in the top probability of 14%.

In the end, the pistons draw the number one draw, the Rockets get the top spot is also fully in line with the probability expected.

Statistics show that this is the third time in the history of the piston team to get the number one signing, and it is also the first time for the team to get the number one signing in recent 51 years. The last time they won the top spot was in 1970, when the pistons picked Bob Lanier.

In 2002, Xiucheng won the number one spot and picked Yao Ming that year. In addition, this is the second time in the history of the Rockets to hold the top spot. The last time they got the top spot was in 1970. The team chose the legendary team history, and now Rudy Tom janovic has been selected into the hall of fame.

But unfortunately, the magic draw is not satisfactory, their ranking fell out of the top 3, just ranked fifth. On the contrary, before the draw, the Cavaliers ranked fifth overtook third.

In addition to the top three, there are also some variables in the ranking of the fourth place. The thunder, which originally ranked fourth, only ranked sixth, while the Raptors, which initially ranked seventh in the draft, overtook fourth.

In addition, according to the previous terms of the deal, the Timberwolves failed to win the top three places, so they signed to the warriors in the first round, and the Bulls failed to win the top four places, so they signed to magic in the first round. And the Rockets because draw to the top spot, so, according to the first four protected agreement, they fortunately retained the draft right.

In the past year, the NCAA Games resumed and the crazy March championship was held again, which provided more samples for NBA teams to investigate the players. According to the preliminary judgment, the overall quality of this year's rookies is obviously better than that of last year.

According to the previous wind review, this year's top three talent draft has begun to show signs. Cade Cunningham, from Oklahoma State University, is likely to be the number one pick of the year. Corningham is 2.03 meters tall and weighs 100 kg. As a ball control core, he has a natural physical advantage. His all-round output ability at both ends of attack and defense also connects people with Luca donchic, who is now a super giant in the league.

Evan Mobley, from the University of Southern California, is the strongest inside line of this draft conference. He is 2.13 meters tall, but his weight is only 98 kg. Mobley's figure is somewhat thin. However, Mobley's playing style completely matches the current NBA basketball trend.

Gyllen saggs of the University of Gonzaga is the most popular of Tanhua, because in the third semi-final of crazy, he won a magical three-point super far pressure whistle. Now, saggs is the top star of the 21st class, and his excellent scoring ability is compared with lilard, Bradley bill and other people.

According to previous reports, the number one favorite, conningham, said that he would only try to train for the team with the number one signing. According to the current judgment, the possibility of the pistons choosing him is also very high.

As for the Rockets, although it's a pity to miss conningham, new stars such as Mobley, saggs and Jay green also have great potential.
