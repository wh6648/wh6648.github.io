On June 23, it was reported that the Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Seventh World War. As a result, they were eliminated. The team's guard Ben Simmons was criticized for his low performance and no desire to attack. Magic Johnson suggested that the 76ers trade Simmons, Shaquille O'Neill said, "if Simmons is my teammate, I will kick him out"... ESPN famous commentator Stephen a-smith today revealed some seemingly troublesome things, he said he received a message from the 76ers insider, the content is about Simmons.

"I received a text message about Ben Simmons who knew the 76ers very well. His message was that Simmons didn't work hard, he didn't listen to other people's advice, he was surrounded by his family and he was always spoiled. I'm quoting from others, not me. " A-smith said.

"I received this short message about Ben Simmons from a very familiar person." A-smith added.

Ben Simmons' performance in the playoffs was very bad. As the team's starting point guard, he averaged only 11.9 points per game and shot 34.2% from free throws. Because of his poor performance on the free throw line, it seems to have affected his aggressiveness. In the second round of the playoffs against the Hawks, Simmons averaged 9.9 points per game, shooting 33.3% and only 6.4 shots per game, which is unheard of for an all star player with height and skill. The 76ers obviously need to solve this problem and make the most of Simmons on the offensive side. Coach Doug Rivers said he made a plan for Simmons this summer and expressed his confidence in the Star Defender.
