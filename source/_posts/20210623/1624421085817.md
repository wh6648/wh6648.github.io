On June 23, Magic Johnson, the famous star of Los Angeles Lakers, talked about the off-season plan of the Lakers when he attended a program recently. He thinks the Lakers should try to get Chris Paul in the off-season.

"There's no doubt about that," Magic Johnson said when asked if Paul thought the Lakers should try to sign Paul if he refused next season's player options. "I'll tell Jennie (bass) to give him some money. For LeBron James and Anthony Davis, he is the perfect partner, for the role players of the Lakers, is also perfect. By his side, you just need to seize the shooting opportunities that you never get

There is no denying that Chris Paul is one of the most important reasons for the Suns' success this season. In fact, he played a key role in the Suns' elimination of the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. It is worth mentioning that Paul's current contract will allow him to leave the suns in the off-season, of course, if he abandons the $44.2 million player option next year. If for some reason, Magic Johnson insists that the Lakers should seize the opportunity to sign the all star point guard, it's definitely a pleasure to see Paul playing side by side with James and Davis in Los Angeles, but in fact, it's not easy to operate. Paul is still in the health and safety agreement, but according to US media reports, Paul will return soon. Paul averaged 15.7 points, 4.1 rebounds and 8.7 assists in the playoffs this season.

As the saying goes, when you can't beat your opponent, join them. For the Lakers, recruit them.
