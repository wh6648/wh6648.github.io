June 23, 2021 NBA draft lottery draw ceremony online. This day, for the Rockets, is no doubt a big day for more than half a year.

In the end, the Rockets got the top spot. That means they are likely to miss this year's number one pick, Cade Cunningham. However, in addition to regret, the Rockets kept their first round signing after all, and there are still many young talents to choose from.

For now, Evan Mobley from the University of Southern California may be the rocket's first choice. Preliminary evaluation shows that Mobley is the strongest insider of this draft conference. Mobley is 2.13 meters tall and weighs 98 kg. Although he is a little skinny, his playing style fully matches the current NBA basketball trend. In addition, as a traditional team with center, the Rockets tend to be quite partial to those talented young insiders.

Gyllen saggs of Gonzaga University is also worthy of consideration by the Rockets, because in the third semi-final of crazy, he won a magical three-point super far pressure whistle. Now, saggs is the top star of the 21st class, and his excellent scoring ability is also compared with lilard, Bradley bill and others.

Jay green, who plays in the League for development this season, is another alternative. Compared with other new stars in universities, green has got the opportunity to work with NBA coaches ahead of time. In the past season, he averaged 17.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.8 assists in G league games, and the output is quite objective. In the eyes of many experts, he is the most outstanding physical talent in this rookie.

Of course, after the draft draw results, some reporters revealed that the Rockets may use this list to trade a more mature star.

However, for this point of view, the Rockets' chief reporter Jonathan Fagan does not agree. He believes that the successful selection of the top spot by the Rockets has taken an important step in the reconstruction, and the Rockets should keep this spot in the future.

Fagan also believes that the Rockets have two other first round signings (from the Blazers and bucks respectively) in addition to the first round signings. Considering that they still have their own first round signings next season, the team's reconstruction prospects are quite good.

Fagan also reminded that the last time the Rockets got to the top was in 1970, when the team chose the legendary team history, and now Rudy Tom janovic, who has been selected into the hall of fame. And this exciting story may reappear this year.

Compared with Fagin's conservative, rocket general manager Rafael stone's theory is more radical. After the draft draw, he gave an interview for the first time and said, "we will get star players through various ways. We hope to build a strong team. Next season is not our goal. Next, there is still a lot of work to do, to make good use of the following period of time. As for how to use the top spot, it will take some time for us to discuss and decide

For example, after today's draft draw, the Rockets have entered a new stage of reconstruction. Next, the team will become more targeted and purposeful.
