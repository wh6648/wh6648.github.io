On April 16, the nets issued an official statement in support of LaMarcus Aldrich's retirement decision.

Adelaide announced his retirement from the NBA on Thursday due to arrhythmia. As a seven time all star, Adelaide has been selected into the best lineup five times in his career, including two second and three third. Throughout his career, Adelaide played a total of 1029 regular season games, averaging 19.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists, with a shooting percentage of 49.1%.

In his retirement letter, Adelaide said that he suffered from arrhythmia in the game against the Lakers last weekend and finally decided to end his career. At birth, Adelaide was diagnosed with clinical death because of no heartbeat. At that time, the doctor didn't give up and rescued Adelaide from death, but so far Adelaide had the problem of congenital heart disease.

Today, the nets general manager Sean - Max issued a statement. "The nets fully support Adelaide's decision. We cherish his short time in the nets. His health is much more important than the game. We know it was a tough decision for him, but after careful consideration and consultation with a large number of medical experts, Adelaide made the best decision for him, his family and life outside basketball. We hope aduh and his family will be healthy and happy in the future. "

Adelaide and the Spurs reached a buyout on the closing day of this year's trade, after which he joined the nets as a free agent.
