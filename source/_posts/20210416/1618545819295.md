On April 16, Brooklyn nets forward LaMarcus Aldrich announced his retirement in an open letter via social media due to arrhythmia. Today, Aldrich mentor, San Antonio Spurs coach Greg Popovich issued a statement to send his best wishes.

"LaMarcus Aldrich has enjoyed a wonderful NBA career. He is a perfect professional with unique skills and a deep respect for the game. We are very grateful for his time with San Antonio Spurs, both on and off the field. We are proud of his hard decision and wish him and his family well in the future, "Popovich wrote in a statement.

It is worth mentioning that Aldrich also expressed his gratitude to the Spurs in his retirement letter: "I thank the Spurs for integrating me into this big family, where I spent five happy years."

In the summer of 2015, Aldrich announced through social media that he would leave Portland Trail Blazers to join the Spurs and sign a four-year top salary contract with a total value of 80 million, with the fourth year as a player option. In five seasons with the Spurs, Aldrich played 376 games, averaging 19.5 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.25 blocks. He was selected as the best team in the League twice and the All-Star team three times. He is the sixth spurs player to achieve 7000 points and 3000 rebounds. In the middle of this season, Aldrich signed a buyout contract with the Spurs. He also gave up his $7.25 million salary in his contract and joined the nets.
