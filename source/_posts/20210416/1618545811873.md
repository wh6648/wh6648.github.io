He was at the peak when I joined the team," Lillard said. "I was an all star in the second and third years of my career. If Adelaide had stayed and CJ had been improving, no one knew what would have happened, maybe we could have gone further. "

Later on a podcast, Lillard said: "I was shocked when I heard the news. I want Adelaide to be healthy and I think basketball is the least important thing in this situation. I understand that this decision is very difficult for him. He needs to make the right decision considering his own physical condition and family. I think it's time to retire Adelaide from the Blazers
