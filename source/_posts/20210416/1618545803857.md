On April 16, Brooklyn nets forward LaMarcus Aldrich announced his retirement in an open letter through social media last night due to arrhythmia. Then Aldrich updated the social media to express his thanks to all the supporters.

"It's been a tough day for me. But I'd like to thank all the people who have contacted me on social media and in real life to give my supporters love. " Aldrich wrote.

In the middle of this season, Aldrich reached a buyout contract with the Spurs. He also gave up his $7.25 million salary in the contract, and then joined the basketball nets. However, Aldrich only played five games for the nets, averaging 12.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. In his 15 career seasons, Aldrich averaged 19.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game, shooting 49.1% of the time. He was selected as the all star seven times and the best team on the 5th.
