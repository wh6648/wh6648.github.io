On March 25, NBA regular season continued to fight fiercely. Among them, Los Angeles Clippers beat San Antonio Spurs 134-101, ushering in three consecutive wins. George once again opened his "God game, ghost game" mode since the all star. He made 8 of 18 shots, contributed 17 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists, and the three-point ball was still 6-in-a-row iron.

This season, George averaged 22.5 points, 6 rebounds, 5.5 assists, shooting 48.1%, three-point 44.1%, free throw 88.7%, all of which are gorgeous.

In particular, the average score, which is "pickled pepper" in recent four seasons since the second highest score. So it seems reasonable for George to get a four-year $190 million contract from the Clippers.

However, after the NBA all star game, George seems to fall into the strange circle of "God one game, ghost one game". In the last six games, George averaged 17.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 39.1% hits, 39.5% three points and 88.2% free throws.

If Leonard decides the height of the Los Angeles Clippers, George decides how far the western team can go in the playoffs.

Against the Spurs, George in the first two quarters of the data is very stable, he played 20 minutes, 11 shooting 5, got 10 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists.

From the third section, the sense of existence of "pickled pepper" began to decline sharply. At the beginning of the game, he was cheated of a three-point foul when defending Spurs' white. After that, the all star made two shots, all of which were iron. The clippers can expand the difference to more than 15 points, relying entirely on Leonard.

At the end of the third quarter, George used a single, his emergency stop to cheat two Spurs players, "pickled pepper" used the time difference to throw to score, ending the personal scoring shortage in this section. In this quarter, he made only one of the four shots, and he was also the fastest player in the Clippers' five scoring doubles, with the lowest percentage of hits, barely reaching 40%.

In the last quarter, George made two singles hits, he contributed 6 points, scored more than 15 points, 17 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. However, "pickled pepper" 18 in this game 8, 3-point ball is 6 throw all lost.
