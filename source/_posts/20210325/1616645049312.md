It's been 14 months since the Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and his second daughter Gigi died in a helicopter crash, but the pain of losing Kobe and Gigi is still lingering in our hearts. Kobe's widow Vanessa is also missing her husband and daughter in various ways.

Vanessa today updated her social media instagram to get a new tattoo. In memory of her late daughter, Vanessa has a beautiful "mambacita" tattoo on her arm, making Gigi a part of her body forever. Obviously, Vanessa can't get out of the haze. She still misses Kobe and Gigi very much, and the tattoos on her body are also related to them. In addition, Vanessa also uploaded several videos of her eldest daughter Natalia tattooing, but it's hard to see the specific content.

In fact, it's not the first tattoo since the death of Kobe and Gigi. Before that, she tattooed Kobe's "sweet message" on her shoulder and neck as if he had never left her.

After Kobe's unfortunate death, fans all over the world are using various ways to commemorate the legend. Just as the Laker superstar LeBron James said, Mamba has "left" our life, but he certainly "will not be forgotten".
