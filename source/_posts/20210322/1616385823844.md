A 40 + game didn't bring victory. Owen said that he wanted to put down "pride". In fact, the great change of the layup net now is the chemical reaction between him and harden, which is perfect. On March 22, 2021, the Nets beat the Wizards 113-106. Owen scored 28 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists.

Owen's opening game was against weishao. After the opening game, the wizard was in a faster state. Owen's first shot was only 8 minutes in the first quarter, a very difficult throw. After that, the wizard played a wave of flow and led to 14 points, which seems to be the normal pattern of the past few games. He fell behind in three consecutive games, once reversed, once failed, and this time was digging.

After the pause came back, Owen took the lead and solved the problem again with a single shot to stop bleeding in time. Three minutes in the first quarter, Owen even shot and robbed himself to finish an assist after rushing and grabbing the rebounds. At this time, the nets had caught up with four points. In the first quarter, Owen's best goal was assists. Harden had only one assists, while Owen sent out four assists.

In the second half of the second quarter, Wesson once attacked Owen provocatively, which stimulated Owen's desire to fight alone. After Wesson hit the ball, he immediately hit the stop shot in return, followed by a chasing three-point shot. Owen and Wesson once formed a confrontation scene, or Owen had the upper hand. Entering the second half, Owen still went to attack reluctantly, even once the attack was around the opponent to complete a drift shot.

In the fifth minute of the third quarter, Owen even chased and robbed the opponent's fast break when he came back to defend. It seems that this kind of defense is only common in Leonard's type. Owen's efforts in the game can be seen. After the snatch, Owen was misplaced and hit Lopez with a backward pitch. Owen was very efficient in attacking solo in this game, and every time he played at the point where the Wizards wanted to fight back.

In the last two minutes of the game, the wizard caught up with one point. At this time, Owen sent out the most critical assist of the whole game. He sent out a through assist outside the three-point line to help Clarkston complete the 2 + 1 slam dunk, which led the nets to four points. In the last minute, it was Owen who snatched Bill's ball. This assist and this snatch were too crucial. In the last 60 seconds, Owen made a free throw and assisted Clarkston in the last 30 seconds to finish the 2 + 1 dunk. In the last 3 minutes, Owen decided the trend of the game and finally led the team to reverse the wizard.
