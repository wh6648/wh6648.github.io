March 22 news, Los Angeles Lakers coach Frank Vogel admitted that in the absence of LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the team is very challenging, but Vogel said that in the absence of the two superstars, strengthen defense will be the key to win.

James suffered a high ankle sprain and will be suspended indefinitely. Local time on March 15, "Yahoo Sports" reporter Chris Haines reported that Anthony Davis (right calf strain) will be absent for three weeks or more.

Talking about James' injury, Vogel said: "this kind of injury takes a while to recover. They are recovering very slowly. We are ready for his indefinite absence
