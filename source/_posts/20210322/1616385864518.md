On March 22, the Rockets lost again, losing 112-114 to the thunder at home, suffering 20 consecutive losses. Since February 7, as long as one and a half months, the Rockets did not win the ball.

After today's loss, the Rockets' 20 consecutive losses set a new record. In NBA history, the longest consecutive loss record is the 28 consecutive loss set by the 76ers. The Rockets lost 20 games in a row, even the ninth worst in history!

Before the game, Rockets star John Wall updated his social media to cheer himself up and the whole team. He wrote, "wake up! Today is game day!"

Against the thunder team, wall's opening performance was good, but with the deepening of the game, his performance gradually extended. Especially at the end of the game, wall didn't save the Rockets. Nine seconds before the end, wall played solo with the ball, but his layup was blocked by Lui Gonz dote. In the last attack, the Rockets still have the chance to win, but Wall didn't score three points.

If wall can score one of the two goals, maybe the end of the game will go to the other side.

The whole game, wall played 35 minutes, 18 shot 7, of which 3-point 7 shot only 1, hand over 24 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals data. Wall's performance has a sense of tiger head and snake tail. The most important thing is that he lost his outside line. Rockets is a team relying on three points, but the performance of wall's outside line is not satisfactory.
