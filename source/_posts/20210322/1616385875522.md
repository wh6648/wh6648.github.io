The Cavaliers are expected to sign a total contract worth more than $100 million with Jarrett Allen this summer, according to US media reports on March 22.

Allen is on the 22nd of the first round in 2017 and will be a restricted free agent at the end of the season. In the off-season, the Cavaliers have the qualification to renew their contract with Allen.

In January this year, in a deal involving James Harden, Allen was sent to Cleveland by the nets as one of the chips. At that time, the Cavaliers were full of people in the interior, but the team still completed the transaction in order to see Allen's potential.

Now Allen is not for sale of the Cavaliers, he is also regarded as one of the core of the team's future. Allen's salary this season is $3.9 million a year and he is sure to get a big contract this summer.

In order to give Allen a chance to show, the Cavaliers gave up Andre Drummond. This Friday is the trade deadline, the Cavaliers are actively touting "Zhuang God", if not successful, the two sides are likely to reach a buyout. On the other hand, the Cavaliers are still listening to Javier McGee's offer.

Sources said the Cavaliers plan to sign a contract with Allen this summer for more than $100 million. So far this season, Allen has played 40 games, averaging 12.9 points, 9.8 rebounds and 1.7 blocks.
