There were 8 minutes and 47 seconds left in the fourth quarter when Owen came back on the court and shot from the outside, but unfortunately the ball popped out of the basket. Five minutes and 52 seconds, Owen hit the basket with the ball. However, when he attacked, he was caught by three men. Owen forced a layup to win a free throw.
