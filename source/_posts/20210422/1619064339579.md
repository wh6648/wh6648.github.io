After beating the 76ers, curry continued his highlight performance. He scored 30 + in 11 games in a row. After entering April, he also scored 40 + five times. These two sets of figures are the new historical records of veterans over the age of 33.

But as soon as Kuri came up, he was in trouble. After a successful layup, he quickly fell into the encirclement of his opponent. During this period, Meng Shen's three-point shot hit the iron and passed the ball in the first half of the first quarter, making four consecutive low-level mistakes.

In fact, it's no surprise that curry was targeted like this. After all, in the past, he was the hottest star in the league, and his hand was even better than at the peak. Now, no team dares to underestimate Meng Shen's explosive scoring power.

Back to today's game, after the first quarter, curry got two points through the layup, but four points was his score in the whole first half.

After that, curry also tried to find the right target outside the three-point line, but he made all the three-point shots in six times, and as soon as he got the ball, the wizard was waiting for two defenders, one in front of the other and the other behind him, ready to pinch him at any time. In the first quarter, the warriors were 18 points behind at the most.

Although, in the second quarter, under the drive of Wiggins, Jordan Poole and others, the warriors gradually close to the score, but no matter how other people score, the wizard's blockade of curry is consistent.

But curry has seen too many storms in his career, and he knows how to adjust in the face of such strict prevention. After Yi Bian's comeback, curry took out a completely different posture. He got a good counter basket and a three-point hit, and quickly recovered his offensive feeling.

With the opening of curry's point, the defense line of the Wizards has become loose, and the players are somewhat hesitant in defense, and some are concerned about one thing and lose the other. Seize the wizard's defensive hesitation, curry even if he does not attack, also can timely send accurate pass to find teammates.

In a single quarter, curry got 10 points, and the output returned to the recent normal level. More importantly, under the leadership of curry, the warriors have successfully surpassed.

At the end of the day, the competition between the two sides became white hot. Under the leadership of bill, the wizard launched a fierce wave of counterattack. But at this time, curry was frozen again. What's more sad is that his most reliable partner, Zhuimeng green, was sent off for the sixth foul, which made the warriors worse. Although curry woke up at the last moment, he scored two critical layups and made the difference return to a round gap in the second reading stage.
