When the wonderful curves of Kuri crossed the dome of Wachovia Center, fell into the basket and splashed "waves", a small number of fans in the 76ers' home court unconsciously defected one after another. At the crucial moment of the decisive victory, the cry of Kuri MVP was particularly clear and loud in the open arena. With 20 points in a single section and 49 points in the whole game, Kuri conquered the picky Philadelphia fans, He even conquered the world with an average of 40.8 points in April.

Since April, curry has been playing 30 + games, averaging 7.2 3-pointer shots per game, with a shooting percentage of 55%, a 3-pointer percentage of 50% and a free throw percentage of 91%. He not only surpassed bill to the top with an average of 31.4 points per game, but also set a series of historical records

In April, he scored 40 + in five single games in the pool, surpassing Jordan and Kobe, becoming the player with the most 40 + Games in a single month among the players over 33 years old in NBA history; he scored at least 30 points in 11 consecutive games, ranking second only to Chamberlain in the history of the team; the total score of the team surpassed Chamberlain in the history of the top team; he hit more than 10 three points in 21 single games in his career, ranking first in the history of the team; For the second time in his career, he scored 50 + at least three times in a single season, second only to Jordan, Kobe and harden. In addition, curry is expected to become the fifth player in the history of the league who scored more than 40 points per game in a single month

The extraordinary performance began in the dressing room after the warriors' disastrous defeat to the Hawks on March 27. In that game, the warriors lost 16 points to the Hawks. After the game, curry made a speech in the dressing room. He hoped that every player in the team would "re evaluate their dedication". Then Curry set an example and returned to the team after ending the truce of tailbone injury ahead of time, On March 30, he led the team to beat the bulls with a 32 point performance and started his own crazy journey.

Before that, the warriors had just suffered a wave of four losses in a row, and the playoffs were far away from them. However, curry brought a wave of 7-5 record with his crazy performance, which brought the warriors back to the ninth place in the Western playoffs. All of these performances make people think not only of the man who once worked hard to carry the team to the playoffs - Kobe Bryant.

Yes, this season's Curry, who has a growing shadow of Kobe. On March 12, the warriors suffered a 26 point defeat to the Clippers. When they fell behind to 24 points in the third quarter, curry stood in front of the bench and yelled at his teammates during a pause. His fists were clenched, his muscles were blue, his voice was hoarse, and his eyes were red. Such a face looked like Kobe, but it was far from the friendly and easygoing curry, It is in this moment that we see the strong competitive heart and indomitable fighting spirit hidden in this baby face.

But all these more intense performances appeared in the fourth quarter when the warriors were defeated by Celtic. With seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, curry sprained his left ankle when trying to get rid of Tatum's defense. At that time, curry was so painful that he patted the floor. But after he got up and walked for a few steps, he didn't rest and dragged his injured leg back to the game immediately, He took a painkiller in a hurry and kept fighting because the warriors were only two points ahead, and he knew how important every victory was to the warriors now. After the half-time game, curry dragged his injured leg and shot three three-point goals... Although he failed to help the team bring back a victory in the end, his action was like a dislocated finger, but he didn't stop for a second, and let the team doctor break back the dislocated position and return to the court.

It turns out that we have always ignored Curry's tenacity and determination, because the glory of the warrior dynasty did not give him too many opportunities to show his other side. Now the team is not the same as before, full of injuries, incomplete lineup, role players are hard to bear heavy responsibilities, the team's fighting spirit is plummeting, and the paper strength of the fish belly seems to be silent about the dismal team record, And all this is not allowed in the eyes of curry, he once had the glory and scenery of the champion, and now also has the stubborn and dignity of the champion.

At the moment when the team needs to win most, he leads the team to win with the way of setting an example on the court and personal heroism. This is Kobe's way and behavior. More importantly, he is using Kobe's attitude to face the team's trough.

Kobe once said: "I believe it's equally important to go through the difficult times and enjoy the good times. I enjoy a lot of success here. You can't escape the bad days after enjoying the success. I never want to leave. I'm the Lakers." That's what Kobe said and did. He didn't leave the Lakers when they were at a low ebb, but carried the team out of the dark and back to glory. Now curry is experiencing the darkness after the glory, and he chose the same attitude as Kobe. He did not complain, did not escape, and did not try to leave and give up. Instead, he used the big ability in his small body to carry the team.

In today's era, in today's era of eager for quick success and instant benefit, unwilling to experience failure, and superstars gathering to win, this alone is enough to make people awe. In fact, in Curry's bones, he has always had a Kobe style heroism plot.

On January 13, 2011, the warriors met the Lakers at home. The two teams were stuck together. Kobe came back to take over the game with 6 minutes and 37 seconds left in the fourth quarter. In the last half of the quarter, Kobe scored 17 points to help the Lakers win. When Kobe made the last two free throws, curry, standing behind him, looked at Kobe with deep eyes. He lost the game and was surprised to see a great performance Maybe since then, or even earlier, curry has been deeply influenced by Kobe. In the following games, curry has never helped the team win as much as Kobe did in that game. After Kobe's death, curry said in an interview that he has been learning from Kobe's spirit and has been inspired by "Mamba spirit".

Walton once said that curry's fighting spirit is no worse than Kobe. "They're really like each other, they're all so good, and they're all eager to win and work hard for it If you look at Stephen, he has to practice shooting after every training, and he puts himself into it wholeheartedly. Kobe did the same thing. A lot of people get complacent after winning one after another, but that doesn't happen to Stephen, Kobe and other great players in the league. What I see is that Stephen and Kobe are not like the players who have won in a row and are defending champions. They still work hard every day, so this is very similar

In such a difficult season for the warriors, in the most critical moment of the playoff card battle, we finally met the never seen curry, the hoarse curry deeply buried behind the baby face, the curry full of Mamba spirit. On the court, the performance of super God is only superficial, and the indomitable rooted in the bone marrow is what we admire most.

The beautiful arcs will continue to pierce the sky, as dazzling as a meteor, while Curry's performance will not be as fleeting as a meteor. He will inherit and continue the spirit of Mamba and lead the warriors to rebuild their brilliance.
