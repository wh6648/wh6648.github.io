On April 22, Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. and Stirling Brown patronized a Stripper Club in Miami, violating the health and safety regulations of the NBA. Meanwhile, they also led to an attack on brown, who was hit on the head by a bottle of wine and suffered multiple cuts on the face.

Brown was reported to have been hit on the head 20 minutes after Brown and other Rockets players left the hotel where the team stayed in coler gables. Miami Dade police said they arrived at the strip club at 6:53 a.m. local time on Monday morning and found Brown "with multiple injuries.".

Reporters shams charania and Kelly IKO jointly reported that Brown was immediately sent to Jackson Memorial Hospital for surgical treatment. The professional player, who has been in the League for four seasons, suffered multiple injuries to his face and body, as well as to his back brain, which led to his vague memory of the accident. It is reported that Brown's family and the Rockets are worried that Brown's condition is very critical due to massive bleeding. Meanwhile, doctors are also worried that Brown's head injury may lead to blood coagulation. Fortunately, Brown was discharged late Monday afternoon and has returned to Houston.

"If he (brown) doesn't have that strong and tough body, he may not be able to get out of trouble on Sunday night, he may be dead," a source said

Another source said: "his (Brown's) face is swollen."

Shams charania and Kelly IKO said Brown was in the wrong car and began to have verbal conflicts with at least three people who seemed to be using the car. As the incident escalated, Brown was attacked. At that time, little Porter was also involved in the dispute and tried to protect brown. These people also had physical conflicts with little porter. In the last 91-113 loss to the heat, although Porter was not injured, he only played for 30 minutes. Since then, Porter has entered into the League health and safety agreement. Rockets coach Silas said Porter will be absent until Sunday local time.

According to the report, the Rockets hope that the NBA will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the matter. It is worth mentioning that the league rules currently prohibit players and staff from going to bars and clubs during the new coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Brown's agent said Brown's team hopes to work with private detectives and Miami police to investigate the incident.

"We are most concerned about the health of Stirling (brown), and we will rely on law enforcement to help find out the truth." Brown's agent said.

In an accident report obtained by shams charania and Kelly IKO, Miami day police officers said Brown and an unidentified person at the scene did not work together. "In trying to get the two men to help and gather information about the incident, they were hostile and refused to cooperate. We have tried to collect information (from brown) many times, but Brown has always insisted that he does not want to provide his own information, he just wants to be sent to the hospital for treatment. " The statement said.

Brown is currently recovering in Houston. Rockets coach Silas said he called brown on Tuesday and contacted him on Wednesday, but he didn't get in touch. Brown is seeing a doctor and working with the team's trainers to recover.

"For me, the most important thing is that he (brown) knows that we are 100% behind him and hope that he will recover as soon as possible and return to his teammates," said Silas.

In addition, Silas said he often talks with players about the league's health and safety agreements and the importance of complying with these rules. "Now, we're talking about a series of things that are not just about the pound. As a team, we've really talked about this (health and safety agreement)... In the last few days... So they absolutely know where I stand on this. It's not a one-time conversation between us and the team, it's a continuous communication with the team Silas said.

Brown, 26, averaged 8.2 points and 4.4 rebounds in 51 games this season.
