May 3 news, Carey Owen in today's strong Eastern dialogue, did not play their best performance. In the face of bucks, Owen played 36 minutes 37 seconds, 21 shots only 8, handed over 20 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals. His positive and negative value on the court is + 3, the highest in the nets starting players.

Owen's offensive efficiency in the first three quarters was not high, and he did not provide strong support for Kevin Durant. Of course, this is also related to the Bucks' defensive strategy. A lot of times, when Owen gets the ball, he gets caught, which makes it very difficult for him to deal with the ball. Bucks understand that strangling the main attack point of the nets is tantamount to breaking the connection between Owen and KD.

At the critical moment of the fourth quarter, Owen suddenly woke up and almost helped the nets finish the counter attack. With 2 minutes to go, the letter brother just finished blocking Durant, and the nets were 109-115 behind by 6 points. Jeff Green grabbed the front court rebound and gave the ball to Owen, who was standing on the outside line. Owen hit three points with a knife. The three points helped the nets narrow the 112-115 gap to three.

In the letter brother won 2 points, 57.0 seconds before the end of the game, Owen broke through the layup and the nets continued to lag 3 points. 3.6 seconds before the end, under Owen's defense, Chris Middleton's rhythm was disturbed, and he failed to score three points before the 24 second offensive whistle, which won the opportunity for the nets to drag the game into extra time.

Five points in the last two minutes showed Owen's personal ability. Unfortunately, his attacking efficiency was not high all the time. In fact, Owen's outside touch in the last three games has been bad, with only 21 shots and 5 hits in total.
