May 3 news, some tragic, Kevin - Durant carrying basket nets forward, but finally missed Jue Ping three points. With 40 points and 10 rebounds, KD's excellent performance didn't help the nets to retreat in Milwaukee.

3.6 seconds before the end, Chris Middleton failed to score three points, KD grabbed the backboard and asked for a pause. At this time, the nets were 3 points behind and had the chance to use the last attack to drag the game into extra time. During the pause, Steve Nash arranged to give the ball to KD. The front court sideline ball is sent out, KD receives the ball at the top of the circle and turns to hand. Because it's a little far from the three-point line, KD's shot is too light, and the ball pops up at the front of the basket. In this way, KD missed three points.

The whole game, Durant's performance is remarkable, he played 39 minutes and 52 seconds, 3-point ball 13 shot 7, hand over 42 points and 10 rebounds, 2 assists and 1 steals the data. KD scored 40 + for the second consecutive game. On April 30, he scored 42 points, 3 rebounds, 10 assists and 1 steals.

KD made history. He became the third player in the history of the nets to score at least 40 points in two consecutive games. The other two are Vince Carter (February 2005) and John Williams (April and December 1978).

On the other hand, in the match between the nets and bucks on January 19, Durant contributed 30 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists. In this way, KD became the first nets player who scored 30 + twice against bucks in a single season after Bernard king in 1977-78.

Today, KD is a little tired. Facing the sharp attack of brother Letterman and bucks, KD is short of helpers. Yes, Carey Owen is not at his best and Joe Harris is not feeling well. In this context, Durant can only carry the nets on his shoulders. In fact, KD's playing time is a little too much, nearly 40 minutes.
