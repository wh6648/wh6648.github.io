On May 20, recently there was a rumor that the heat would be Leonard's potential next home. Mingji Woshen said in an episode of the show that he is likely to stay on the Clippers.

A few years ago, the free market in the summer of 2021 would have been one of the most exciting free markets in history. The reality is that with the letter brother, Paul George, gobel and other stars have signed a contract extension ahead of time, each remaining in his previous team, everyone's excitement about the free market this summer has gradually subsided.

But the free market is always interesting, and there may still be some big stars coming into the free market. Leonard, in particular, has player options for next season and is likely to opt out of his contract this summer to become an unrestricted free agent. But even if he jumps out of his contract, will he really leave the Clippers?

According to ESPN's latest podcast, at least so far, there are signs that Leonard likes to stay in Southern California, and he gets along well with coach Taran Lu.

"I think Carla will stay on the Clippers. Although he hasn't made it public, it may be kept until the day when he signs the contract. I know someone has mentioned Miami about whether the heat can be his potential next home He said.

"Geographically, Leonard is where he wants to be. I think he gets on well with the team, the management and the owners He added, "I think it's been a really good season for them. In Los Angeles, the description I heard about taranlu is that he can hurt people invisibly, and he can train you very hard to make everyone responsible. I think that's the environment Leonard likes and it's good for the team

"However, if the Clippers get out earlier than expected, things could get worse." He said.

As Warsaw finally pointed out, nothing can be guaranteed at the moment. The clippers have a lot to prove in this season's playoffs. If they are defeated in the first round against the lone ranger, or Leonard's relationship with the team breaks down, of course, he is likely to reconsider his future.

At the moment, it would be very meaningful if Leonard renewed his contract with the Clippers. He signed with the Clippers for the first time in the summer of 2019 because he wanted to go back to his hometown to play, and if it doesn't matter to him, he is unlikely to make a sudden decision.
