With the end of the regular season of 2020-21, the League will award seven personal Honors: general manager of the year, coach of the year, sixth man of the year, progressive player of the year, defensive player of the year, rookie of the year and most valuable player. American media "bleachers" invited seven experts to hold a round table meeting to predict the winners.

1. Best general manager

Shawn Marx took over as general manager of the Brooklyn nets in 2016, inheriting a team that lacks talent and talent. He has done a great job in this period of time, which is due to the January trade, he got James Harden from the Houston Rockets. Now the nets have become one of the playoff champions.

From temporarily hiring Steven Nash as the team's head coach to signing Griffin and Adelaide in the buyout market, mark made the team continue to move forward despite several injuries.

Owen, harden and Durant still need to prove their value in the playoffs, but Max has made his own contribution in gathering a strong force.

There are risks in any operation in the NBA, but there are also risks in inaction. Max sent away leville, Jarrett Allen and important draft rights, but the chance to win in the league is precious. He should not only be awarded the best general manager of the year, but also the best general manager in five years.

2. Best coach

In the eyes of the public, most of the credit for the sun's leap from the lottery to the second seed in the West will go to Chris Paul. But if it wasn't for the team culture advocated by coach Monty Williams, Paul might never have been interested in joining the sun.

Paul and Monty Williams had a relationship when they were in New Orleans. Their cooperation this year has continued the sun's 8-0 record in bubble park last season.

If there are three votes on this option, the second place will go to Tom sybodou, who had a similar transformative impact after his first season with the Knicks. Thibodou led the Knicks into the playoffs for the first time since the 2012-13 season. In the third place, I will choose McMillan. He took over the job of Lloyd Pierce in the season, and also made the eagles complete the transformation. After a 14-20 start, he won 26-11 and successfully entered the playoffs.

3. The best sixth person

It seems that it is our duty to mention Jordan Clarkson first, who is in line with the classic "I'll score" sixth man model of Jamal Crawford leway. Clarkson seemed to be in great shape early in the season, but he hasn't been that efficient recently. Before the all star game, his real hit rate reached 58.1%, which dropped to 51.1% after the all star game, far below the league average. Clarkson's 18.2 points per game is still valuable, at least for the top five or even the third.

His teammate, Joe ingers, a ginobillian player, his high scoring efficiency and excellent organization deserve to win the award for him, both of which are crucial to the dominant position of the jazz.

Of the 190 players who have made at least 400 shots this season, ingers ranks second in the true percentage of hits. His three-point shooting rate is as high as 45.3%, mostly from dribbling. Ingers surpassed 99% and 97% of the league's players in scoring and assists, respectively. You can say that in the league, no other player can be more reliable than him to achieve efficient attack by shooting or passing.

Ingers' lack of the ball can not be ignored. At the same time, he is also a good pick and roll player. He gave Gabel 75 assists, second only to the starting point guard Conley, who spent seven more minutes with Gabel in each game.

Ingers averaged 12.1 points and 4 assists per game, but his efficiency is undoubtedly very high. Maybe Clarkson will win this award, but in my heart ingers is a better choice.

4. Best progressive player

Randall deserves the best progressive player award. Although he always has the air of filling up the scores in the data column, the way he plays this season is obviously different. He began to have a backward three-point, difficult bottom line jump shot, his pass is no longer the last choice, but after careful consideration. Even when he lost his center of gravity after being defended, it seems that he made a jump shot intentionally rather than in a hurry. Moreover, under the guidance of thibodu, his defensive strength has greatly improved.

All these results are hard to ignore: he averaged 24.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and six assists per game, with a three-point shooting rate of 41.1%. All the data are career high, and greatly improved compared with last season. This is not only a person who makes full use of his opportunities, it is a comprehensive leap. He has changed from an excellent NBA player to a candidate and the core of a playoff team, which is very difficult to complete.

It is precisely because of his role and the difficulty of realizing these progress that Randall has a decisive advantage among the competitors. Grant has always been the most popular player for this award in the first half of the season, but his playing time is obviously less than Randall's, and his development is completely limited to his ability as a scorer.

Alexander would have been a strong contender for the award if he hadn't been absent because of a torn fascia in his right foot. Porter is also worth considering. He has been playing with Nuggets stars joachi and Murray all season. But in any case, Randall will be the best player to improve and his advantage is clear.

5. Best defensive player

I believe that in the choice of the best defensive player, we generally think it is Gabel or Ben Simmons, but who do we choose? It's not an easy thing because the two men are not playing in the same position.

But if we combine somatosensory with data, then the leader will be Gabel. Even though he has won the DPOY award twice, he has made no less contribution this season, leading the Utah Jazz to become the first defensive team in the NBA and creating the best record in the league. He is still the best force to protect the basket, averaging 2.7 blocks per game, ranking first in the league. At the same time, he also shows the growth of his outside defense and the progress of his overall pace.

Gerber can improve the Jazz's defense efficiency by 12.1 points per 100 rounds, while Simmons can only improve the defense efficiency of 76 players by 3.1 points per 100 rounds. At the same time, Gerber was able to limit his opponent's shooting percentage to 14.4% lower than the average. Of course, there is no absolute measure of Gerber's defensive performance in terms of data, because it will lead the opponent to constantly choose the middle distance jump shot and challenge him under the basket.

Maybe the voters' aesthetic fatigue may make some votes cast for Simmons, but it is optimistic that goebbel will become the best defensive player of the season again.

6. Best rookie

Although the efficiency and influence of lamello Bauer are very high, but his wrist injury still affects his competitiveness. Top scorer Edwards played 21 more games than three goals, averaging 19.1 points per game. In the previous rookie season, only Zion, Dong Qiqi, Trey young, Mitchell, enbid and lilard can get the average points.

Recently, Edwards is very efficient as a rookie guard. His shooting percentage in April and may was 46.9%, and he can combine explosive power, creativity and shooting ability. He was able to get what he wanted out of the cell phone, to make three-point shots with sophisticated speed and to make difficult jump shots. Despite the Hornets' 33-38 record, the Timberwolves have become more competitive in Edwards' recent progress.

Although I prefer three goals in the long run, Edwards' performance in the second half of the season will give him an advantage in the rookie of the year.

7.MVP

For most of the season, I've been fully behind him. His offensive and defensive advantage as a big man is really special in today's NBA. It's hard for any player to match it.

However, after the Nuggets lost Murray, Jokic, as the real engine of the team, led the Nuggets to remain competitive and threatening. His performance made the MVP's ownership undisputed. He is the reason why nuggets can also be at the top of the list in the superior western regions.
