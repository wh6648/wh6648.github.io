May 20 news, "Houston Chronicle" reporter Jonathan - Fagan in interaction with netizens, talked about John - wall's future in the Rockets.

Wall has two years left on his current contract, with a total value of nearly $92 million¡° Obviously, considering the contract, it would be very difficult for him to trade, "says Fagan. During the regular season, wall played 40 games for the Rockets, averaging 20.6 points, 6.9 assists and 3.2 rebounds.

Is wall suitable for the Rockets¡° When did he fit in? The Rockets have made huge changes in their point guard positions in the past two years, from Chris Paul to Russell Westbrook and then to wall, "Fagan said." the team thought that this change could solve their problems, but it soon became a new problem for the team, while those who left were just like fish in water in other teams. "

"Wall had an encouraging performance in his first year in Houston, but his shooting percentage (40.4%) and average assists (6.9) were career lows," Fagan said. "The most important thing is that he only played 40 games. The Rockets need to consider a question, when they need to cultivate young Kevin Porter and the next first round show at the same time, is it worth giving wall 32-36 minutes per game and a lot of ball rights? "

"If the Rockets choose to cut and delay the payment of wall's contract at this point, it will be a huge loss in the next five years," Fagan said. "It may be meaningful to buy out wall in the near future, but not now."

Fagan pointed out that this is the best choice for the Rockets, the team can only hope to keep wall in the second half of the season.
