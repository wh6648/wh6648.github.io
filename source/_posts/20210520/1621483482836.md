On May 20, Los Angeles Clippers star Coway Leonard talked about his physical condition and the important factors needed by the winning team in an interview today.

"I feel good, I'm ready. I'm in good shape for the game Leonard said of his physical condition.

"I feel good and as confident as ever. I'm... I haven't looked back on the regular season that has ended. For me, I'm still going on this season. Once I stop, I'll go back to the whole season, but now I'm trying to move forward step by step. I have great confidence in this team Leonard continued.

When talking about the difference between the champion team and other teams, Leonard said: "in the final analysis, the most important part is discipline. There will always be things you can't control, such as health. We can control the main part of the defense, discipline, concentration and control of the details of the game Leonard continued.

Leonard has played 52 games this season, averaging 24.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.6 steals.
