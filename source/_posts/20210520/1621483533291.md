May 20 news, reports from the U.S. media, Nets coach Steve Nash in an interview today, talked about the first round playoff opponent Celtic.

"They're a great team, they have a great coaching team, we need some time to prepare," Nash said. "In the regular season, we've played three games with the green army, and the lineup is different, so it doesn't have much reference value for this series."

In this season's regular season, the nets are 3-0 against the green army, with a total of 45 points. But in these three games, the three giants have not played together. Kevin Durant and Carey Owen played one game, Owen and James Harden played one game, and Owen led others to play one game.

Obviously, for the nets, the top priority of the series is to mark Jason Tatum. Tatum scored 50 points against the Wizards in the play off on Wednesday¡° He's a big guard and he's going to be tough, "Nash said." we're going to have to wrap him up to slow him down

The task of marking Tatum will fall on KD¡° KD needs a lot of time to mark Tatum, he will have an important impact on both sides of the offensive and defensive, "Nash said.

Nash revealed that he recently had a video research class with KD, Owen and harden.

On the other hand, the nets had previously announced that more fans would be allowed in the playoffs. "It's exciting and it's important to get more fans in," Nash said
