On April 15th, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were clearly difficult to eliminate. In order to minimize losses, the NBA alliance had to arrange more games in a limited time. Under such intensive schedule, injuries were widespread among all people, so the four words of "season reimbursement" frequently appeared. Several teams are worried that the health of the players has reached boiling point. Some of the league's general managers, coaching staff members and trainers expressed these concerns in an interview with ESPN.

"There's no doubt that this is the worst schedule I've seen in the league in 25 years, and it's totally crazy." An experienced assistant coach in the League said.

"It's cruel." A senior NBA coach said when talking about the schedule.

"It's much worse than the bubble in Orlando." A senior trainer said. "Entering the bubble era, we have all kinds of anxiety about the game, but there is no away travel, which is a cumulative effect."

"I've never experienced such a flood of injuries." One NBA general manager added.

Although there are various factors leading to injuries, some League executives and team health officials point out that the two problems (intensive schedule and injuries) are at least related. According to Elias Sports Bureau, 15% of the players were absent in 2021, only in 2014-15 season, which was higher than that (16.8%).

"Soft tissue damage can happen every day, and it can only get worse." One NBA general manager said.

"In the planning of this season and last season, we communicate with all teams and NBA players every day to reach an agreement on two completely different season models, which are meaningful for the safe operation during the new coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately, injuries have always been a part of the game, but this season's injury rate is not higher than last season's. We will continue to work with the team and players to finish our season in the best and safest way possible and to promote physical and mental health in this challenging period A spokesman for the alliance said in an interview with ESPN. Citing internal data, the spokesman said that in the past 50 games, the number of injuries (resulting in players missing at least one game) was lower than last season and was within the league's range for the past five seasons.

Several team executives said that in at least one pre-season conference call, the team's general manager expressed these concerns to league leaders, including President Xiao Hua. The hidden worry in the planning schedule is to finish the season before the Tokyo Olympics on July 21, which is a tough deadline. The second half of the season is much tighter. According to ESPN data, the Spurs and Grizzlies have 11 back-to-back games in the second half of the competition, which is also the most in the league, while the Grizzlies have 22 games in the form of four days and three games, which is the most in the league. The heat, on the other hand, played 27 games in 51 consecutive days (from January 13 to March 4), with no more than one day off.

ESPN reporter Tim Macmahon quoted data provided by the league office as saying that in the 2019-20 season, each team will play an average of 3.42 games a week, while in the 2020-21 season, this number will increase to 3.6 games, jumping to 3.75 games after the all star game.

To make matters worse, team executives and team health officials described a domino effect: substitutes who had previously played had to play a few more minutes because of the absence of other players.

"We have acquiesced in this mode of survival." One NBA general manager said.
