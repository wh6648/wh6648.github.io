Today, away against the thunder, curry's state is still extended. In the first quarter, he didn't warm up too much, so he quickly hit the three-point ball from the outside.

Thunder doesn't know Kuri's strength, but with the current staffing of Russian city, it's very difficult for them to impose all-round restrictions on mengshen. So in the following games, curry continued to display his projection skills. Because of his weak opponent, the warriors' other players also played very leisurely.

In the second half, he took out more amazing offensive firepower. During this period, he continued to hit a string of three points, and his hand speed became faster and faster, and the difficulty became higher and higher.

Six more three-point goals in a single quarter, and Curry's three-point hits were easily in double.
