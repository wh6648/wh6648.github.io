On April 15, Golden State Warriors star Stephen curry scored 53 points against nuggets, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain and becoming the first man in the history of the warriors. Yesterday, the warriors did not train, Drummond green invited curry to dinner to celebrate this milestone. It is worth mentioning that what makes this dinner more special is that it includes a bottle of 2015 red wine. That year, they won their first NBA championship in their lives. The bottle of red wine starts at about $50000, but is paid by warriors boss Joe lakob.

"By the way, Joe is incredible," says dream green, who also posted photos of himself having dinner with curry on social media. "That bottle of wine was expensive, but Joe asked us to charge it to the team's bill, so we thank him very much. You don't get permission to buy a bottle of La t ид Che every day, so shout for Joe, man. Of course we appreciate it, but obviously there is a reason. When Reggie Miller said that curry is "Mr. warrior", I don't think there is a better description

"It's incredible to surpass Chamberlain in any case," dream green continued. "I feel like I'm back in my rookie season. At that time, Stephen curry just recovered from ankle surgery. The whole management, team owners and all the people are standing on the sidelines to watch his training. Because he has just finished ankle surgery, they are talking about whether to delay (Curry's comeback time)

"I remember bits and pieces of the past, where he (curry) came from, where he is now, and what he has experienced to be in his present position. Share that moment with him and let him know, "brother, I appreciate you very much. You are great. As long as I am by your side, I will celebrate for you.". I can't take the place of others, but as long as I'm here, I'll celebrate for him, because he deserves it. It's a great time to share that bottle of red wine. " Dream Green said.

Dream green and curry won three championships together, and in the process, they established deep feelings. When curry overtook Chamberlain, dream green and curry hugged each other. Curry said it was a wonderful moment.

"He (dream green) contributed too much to the 17818 points." Curry said, "the chemical reactions we have developed together have raised each other's competition to a new height. It was a special moment. I am very grateful for his help to me, my help to him, and our everlasting friendship. Many new players in the team may not have played with me for a long time, but clay (Thompson) and dream green are important factors for my personal achievement and the success of the team, as well as for our whole team. When I personally get what honor, I will think for the first time who contributed the most, their efforts and attitude towards the game helped me to succeed. So it was really a special moment
