The Los Angeles Lakers have a long way to go this season. Jamie's double nuclei suddenly stopped injury when the situation was good. Fortunately, after a wave of setbacks, the Los Angeles Lakers gradually found the feeling of beating Cavaliers, magic and other weak teams, and then beat the hot nets. The team maintained a good record. All this is inseparable from the deep foundation of the academic coach Frank Vogel, who has built a civilian system to help the team through the difficulties.

Vogel had built the civilian lineup of George, Granger, Ebert, David West, hill and Stephenson in the Indiana Pacers period, and still matched the invincible heat in the team's lack of "star flavor". After leaving the Pacers, he spent two failed seasons with the Orlando Magic and was eventually fired. Vogel was not discouraged. He declined the invitation of sports program analyst and rockets defense assistant and spent his time studying the game. He kept close contact with Celtic "young coach" Stevens and often had dinner together to discuss the details of the game.

So when Vogel came out to coach the Lakers, his level had improved by leaps and bounds. Vogel has organized a coaching team including Kidd, Hollins, Phil handy, miles Simon, Mike pampesi and Quentin Crawford. He has determined and adhered to the basic principles of the team - heavy defense and long rotation.

He has built a top defensive system, which is rich in content. In addition to man marking, there are regional joint defense and full court pressing. The defense is strict at all levels, and the defense rate is high. Try not to give the opponent empty opportunities, so as to destroy the opponent's offensive rhythm and fluency. Even if Zhan Mei is absent this season, the defensive efficiency is still 105.5, ranking first in the league. A strong defensive system is the guarantee for the Lakers to win. Just as Vogel said, "I always ask for the strength, proficiency and enthusiasm of high-level defense. You can be brilliant, but if you don't respect the defensive end more than your opponent, you can't win at a high level, which is the expectation of our team."

But he didn't give up the team's attack. When he arranged his troops, he adopted "taking doctrine" for all kinds of tactics. No matter the retro double tower play, or the modern one big four small play, or even the five small play, whether in positional warfare or fast attack, he used it for reference. He would not blindly copy the fashionable magic ball, fast play whirlwind and space basketball. When Zhan Mei was on the scene, he built the star system, and added the thick eyebrow low singles system on the basis of Zhan Mei system to enhance the team's sense of attack level. With Zhan Mei's truce, he built a civilian attack system, joined the strong and weak side cooperation, ran without the ball and other contents to improve the attack efficiency: with Schroeder as the first holding core, he tried to improve the organization of the tandem team, at the same time, he also increased the holding core tasks of Caruso, Tucker and little Gasol. The Lakers added a burst of points and pick and roll tactics, by the ball holder for Harrell and Zhuang Shen feed cake cut points. In addition, Vogel increased the proportion of independent attack of Kuzma, Damo and Zhuangshen. After Jamie's truce, it's not easy for the Lakers to drop their offensive efficiency to 109.8 (the 20th in the League). They can still beat some weak teams and maintain a winning rate of about 50%.

Vogel insisted on long rotation, let the players do their best, at the same time control James and thick eyebrow playing time to ensure health and physical fitness, on the other hand, he attaches importance to the development of player potential, training new players, Kuzma, kaluso and tucker have been fully exploited, to achieve long rotation and low consumption; he also knows how to improve the old players' new skills, such as increasing Harrell's defensive level, in order to break in the defensive system. Vogel can realize the mutual substitutability of players. For example, Schroeder Caruso and little Tucker, pop and Matthews, Gasol Harley and Zhuang Shen can all be replaced by mirror images to avoid a player's bad state affecting the overall situation. However, these players have their own characteristics and can adapt to different situations.

In order to protect the players, he won't overuse the main force, don't care about the gain and loss of one pool in one city, some games don't need to work too hard, save physical fitness and body to prepare for the playoffs. Despite injuries this season, James, Chou Mei and Schroeder have played 33.9 minutes, 32.8 minutes and 31.8 minutes respectively, which did not add extra time.

Vogel abandoned Wharton's practice of "no shooting coach" and introduced player technology development coaches Phil handy, Greg Saint Jean, drew ansrop and shooting coach Pepe to do a good job in scientific and rigorous training. The coaching team has worked out the overall training arrangements throughout the whole season, including training days, competition days and rest days, listing the skills that need to be mastered, accurate to every hour of the day, including individual training, collective attack and defense training and special competition situation training. According to the idea of "decomposition complete practice", the training elements include warm-up (stretching, Pilates, yoga and cycling), running position, holding the ball, no ball, shooting, defense and practical training. Because the off-season period is only two months, the Laker's vacation to participate in the finals is too short, the physical reserve is seriously insufficient, the team is forced to replace training with games, and the number of collective training is very small; but Vogel has formulated a scientific and reasonable training plan, repeatedly instilling ideas into the players, strengthening memory, adding skills layer by layer, smoothly polishing the offensive and defensive system, with high training efficiency and remarkable results. Zhuang Shen's rapid integration into the system after joining is a clear example.

Vogel is famous for his careful pre match preparation, which includes several steps

First, the scouts conduct on-the-spot reconnaissance and intelligence collection for the last match before the match to form a reconnaissance report. The content of the reconnaissance report is detailed, including the opponent's offensive tendency, defensive tendency and the implemented playing method.

Second, video editing. The video editors drew ansrop and Jon pastoc split the opponent's game video into segments, and classified the clips according to attack, defense, specific play, mistakes, rebounds, etc.

Third, make a proposal plan, assistant teaching Kidd and Hollins make a proposal plan according to the reconnaissance report, data analysis and statistical results, video clips, etc. It is suggested that as many alternatives as possible should be set up for subsequent use.

Fourth, adequate preparation for the competition day. Wager's coaching team will organize a coach meeting to watch the opponent's last game video and discuss the optimization and adjustment of the proposed plan; wager's style is humorous, brainstorming, brainstorming, guiding the teaching assistants and staff to think, and finally the coaching team will agree on a complete defense plan and prepare a backup plan. After that, he will call the players to watch the reconnaissance report, video and game suggestion plan, implement the ideas of the coaching team, discuss and finalize the game plan together, and then the players will go on the field simulation exercise and shooting practice.

It is reported that the average difference between the winning and losing of NBA games is only 4 points, so the on-the-spot command and the adjustment of the game process are very important. Vogel is remarkable in this respect. He and the teaching assistants can modify the plan according to the game situation and rhythm, change the strategy and counterpoint; the team data records and statisticians make statistical charts, and feed back to the coaches and teaching assistants. After the game, Vogel also organized coaches and players to summarize, feel and evaluate after the game. On April 11, 2021, in the first game between the Lakers and the nets, Vogel made use of the new recruit mclarmo, and hit the opponent with three points in a row. This is his masterpiece.
