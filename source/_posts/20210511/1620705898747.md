On May 11, NBA officials announced that Russell Westbrook of the wizards and Boyan Bogdanovic of the Jazz were elected the best player in the East and west of last week.

This is the 20th time in his career that Williams won the best of the Week Award. His last time was on April 8, 2019 when he was a member of the thunder team. Weishao led the wizards to a 3-1 record last week, during which he averaged 22.3 points, 18.3 assists and 17.3 rebounds per game. Weishao has become the first person in NBA history to average at least 22 points, 18 assists and 17 rebounds in four games. Last week, he led the league in assists and rebounds per game.

Willis scored three doubles in all four games last week. He became the first person in the history of the wizards to send at least 15 assists in four consecutive games, and the first person since Rajan Rondo in 2016. Statistics show that Williams has cut 35 triple doubles this season. He only needs one more triple double to surpass Oscar Robertson and become the player who has cut the most triple doubles in NBA history!

At the end of last week's game, the Wizards narrowly beat the Pacers 133-132 in extra time, with Williams scoring 33 points, 19 rebounds and 15 assists. This is the 181st triple double of his career, thus equating Robertson. In that game, the last defense in overtime, weishao finished the winning block.

Bogdanovic became the first jazz player of the week since March 19, 2019. This is the second time that Bogdanovic has won the best of the week in his career. He won the best of the week for the first time in February 2019 when he was a member of the Pacers.

Last week, Bogdanovic led the jazz to a 4-0 record. During this period, he had 29.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.5 assists and a shooting percentage of 62.3%.
