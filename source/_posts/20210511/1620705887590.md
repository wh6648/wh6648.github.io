On May 11, news from New York media reported that informed sources revealed that the Knicks hope to further strengthen the lineup in the off-season.

Sources said that the top priority of the Knicks this summer is to negotiate with Julius Randall for an early contract extension. Randall's annual salary next season is $19.8 million, of which only $4 million is guaranteed. In this context, if the two sides complete a four-year contract extension this summer, then Randall's annual salary for the 21-22 season will be converted to full security, and the Knicks can provide a maximum of $106.4 million security salary for the next four years. With various incentives, Randall will get nearly $140 million in five years.

But if Randall is still an all star next year, he can sign a five-year top salary contract worth $201.5 million when he becomes a full free agent in the summer of 2022. Obviously, this is much higher than the early renewal this year.

At the same time, the Knicks are keeping a close eye on Damian Lillard and any other star who might be looking for a deal if there is something wrong with their team.

In addition, there are three guards in the Knicks team this summer's target list, respectively, Kyle Lowry, Dennis Schroeder and ronzo Bauer. It is worth mentioning that they will all test the free market this summer.
