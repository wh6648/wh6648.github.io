May 11 news, reports from the U.S. media said that the Nets coach Steve Nash revealed in an interview today that he believes James Harden has absolute hope of returning in the regular season.

The regular season is coming to an end. Before the start of the playoffs, the nets have four regular season games to play against the bulls, spurs, bulls and Cavaliers.

So is harden expected to be back before the playoffs start¡° Of course, it is possible, but even if he comes back, we will observe his injury every day, "Nash said. Obviously, all the signs are positive. "

"Now we need to focus on how to make the most reasonable (comeback) plan for harden," Nash continued. "At this stage, I dare not promise anything, because everything is changing, the team will make the most reasonable decisions according to the daily development."

"I can only say that harden is definitely hopeful of playing one or more of the last four regular season games of the season," Nash said.

Since April 6 against the Knicks, harden has been absent due to a hamstring injury. In the absence of "mustache", the performance of the nets team fluctuated.

So far this season, harden has played 34 regular season games for the nets, averaging 37.3 minutes, 25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 11.0 assists and 1.3 steals.
