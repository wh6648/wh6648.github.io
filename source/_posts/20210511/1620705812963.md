On May 11, the Wizards lost 124-125 to the eagles. Russell Westbrook scored 28 points, 13 rebounds and 21 assists. In his career, the total number of triple doubles in the regular season reached 182, thus surpassing "Big O" Oscar Robertson (181 times) to occupy the first place in the league history triple doubles list. From 1974 to now, Robertson's identity as the "three double kings" of history has been out of reach for a long time. After 47 years, Wei Shao has finally surpassed his predecessors.

The game between the wizards and the Hawks is about the ranking of the team, and both teams try their best. As a leader of the team, especially in the absence of Bradley bill, Willis took the lead and scored an accurate three-point goal to open the scoring mode of the team. In 6:38, although the Hawks improved their defense and snatched the ball, Williams not only put the ball into the basket, but also caused Bogdanovic to foul and make a penalty hit. In the first quarter, Wei Shao scored 10 points.

Compared with the data, Williams is more eager to win the game. See teammates have a good chance to attack, Wei Shao will never attack. In the next four minutes and three seconds, when Wei Shao reached the bottom of the basket with the ball to attract two defenders, he passed the ball to Bachun in the rear. He saw the ball pass through the Hawks, and the whole team fell into the hands of Bachun, who lived up to expectations and sent the ball into the basket. There have been countless such wonderful passes.

Another long-distance fight, 9 minutes and 11 seconds, weishao assists to complete the attack, which is weishao's 10th attack in this game. After that, Wei Shao scored three points on the outside line to help the wizard level the score to 71. At the end of weishao, the eagles blasted a wave of 17-2 attack climax, but under, weishao can only come on the court again.

Although the key fourth quarter, Wei Shao relies on personal ability to break through to the basket to help the team chase points. In 8 minutes and 30 seconds, Gallinari failed to attack, and Willis rebounded. This was his 10th rebounding in this game, and his 182nd career triple double was officially achieved. Oscar Robertson kept a 47 year record and was surpassed on May 11, 2021. 30.1 seconds before the end, Wei Shao hit the jump shot, once narrowing the difference to 1 point. It's a pity that Wei Shao didn't get three points in the end.

Wei Shao set many records in the battle of God, which is destined to go down in history. In his career, he won 182 triple doubles, surpassing Robertson and enjoying the first place in the league history; Wei Shao's three double wins have reached 137 so far in his career, and he continues to break the NBA historical record maintained by himself; This is the third time in his career that he has won at least 30 + triple doubles in a single season; Weishao officially broke through the milestone of 8000 assists in his career and became the fourth player in history to achieve at least 20000 points + 8000 assists. Before weishao, he was able to achieve at least 20000 points + 8000 assists. The top three players were Oscar Robertson, Gary Payton and LeBron James.

For a long time, Wei Shao has been questioned a lot. He will be criticized for his inefficient attack. He will be criticized for deliberately brushing data. He will be criticized for being too arrogant and paranoid. He will be defined as a loser because he does not have a championship. After every triple double, he will cause a wave of war of words. He is regarded as a stubborn stone that cannot be polished by years. This kind of doubt, this kind of attack has been accompanied by weishao shuttle in every city of every stadium. However, it is undeniable that weishao has replaced Robertson as the new spokesman in the field of "triple double".

"You'd better appreciate Wei Shao with your heart. He's a gift from heaven." That's what Crawford said.

Indeed, we should learn to appreciate his greatness. Legendary magician Johnson said of weishao: "what he can do, I hope we will say, give him love and respect. It's really great, and I can't do it all. "

Whenever he stands on the field, Wei Shao will have the same attitude - give everything. In this journey, he should be more grateful for his persistence and dedication, which is really not easy, because the stars never rely on talent, but the degree of effort. You know, Wei Shao can't dunk in high school, and can fly away after entering the NBA. The hard training is unimaginable.

In the 2008 draft conference, Williams was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics (the predecessor of Oklahoma City Thunder) in the fourth place of the first round, starting his NBA career. In the first four seasons of his career, Williams sent out eight triple doubles. In 2014-15 season, the situation began to change. In that year, Kevin Durant only played 27 games because of injury. Wei Shao, who led the team alone, ushered in the harvest season in terms of data and personal honor. He won three doubles 11 times in a single season and won his first scoring champion.

In the 2015-16 season, weishao has increased the number of triple doubles in a single season to 18. In the 2016-17 season, with Durant's departure, weishao showed more powerful strength, with an average contribution of 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists, becoming the first person in NBA history and winning the scoring champion again. Wei Shao won three doubles 42 times in a single season, was selected into the first team of the best team for the first time, and won the MVP title in the regular season. It is worth mentioning that in the All-Star game of the season, Willis won the All-Star MVP and became the first player to defend the All-Star MVP title after Bob Petit in 1959.

In 2017-18 season and 2018-19 season, weishao once again completed the data of average triple doubles in the regular competition field, and the record of average triple doubles in the regular competition field for three consecutive seasons is unprecedented, and there is no future. In these two seasons, weishao's triple doubles were 25 and 34 respectively.

In the 2019-20 season, Williams was sent to the Houston Rockets by the thunder. On February 15, 2019, Williams scored 44 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in the pelican game, scoring three doubles in the 11th game in a row (from January 3 to February 15, 2019), which once again broke the history of the NBA. The previous record of three doubles in the NBA was held by Chamberlain for nine consecutive games. However, this season, Wei Shao only got three doubles in eight of 57 games, failing to reach the milestone of averaging three doubles for four consecutive seasons.

In the off-season, Willis applied for a deal with the Rockets. He hoped to join a team controlled as he did in the thunder era and finally come to Washington. At the beginning of the season, Wei Shao was not in good condition, but with the recovery of his body, the original Wei Shao came back again. But today, Wei Shao surpasses Robertson to monopolize the league history three double list first, obviously, this record itself already was great enough.

Thank you, VISO, for making us part of Russell Westbrook history night!
