On June 26, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. The Milwaukee Bucks are at home for the second game of the Eastern Conference finals against the Atlanta Hawks. At the end of the game, the Bucks beat the Hawks 125-91, bringing the total score of the series to 1-1.

In the last battle, the Bucks lost their home game, which was somewhat unexpected.

The reason for this result, on the one hand, is due to the bucks on Trey - Yang's defensive limit is really bad, they use huoledi main defense, other people's wheel consumption strategy. However, there are enough defenders, but the intensity of defense is obviously not enough. Therefore, blowing Yang killed all sides, scoring 48 points in a single game, creating a personal high, which is also recorded in the history of the playoffs.

After the game, huoledi talked about the counterpoint with Trey Yang and said that he should give strength to the other side in G2.

Holiday brother really did what he said. When he came to this game, he felt the different intensity from the first game. It took him three minutes to open the attack account by breaking through and throwing. Next, under the pressure of the opponent, blowing Yang is a series of mistakes.

Obviously, for the breakthrough of blowing Yang, the bucks are fully prepared. They put up a fence near the three second area early, and there are players standing on the breakthrough line of blowing Yang early. The assault line was blocked, and the attack area of blowing Yang was forced to move out, and his efficiency naturally declined.

What's more troublesome for him is that the Bucks have already made a judgment on his shooting route. Once he fails to shoot, his defenders will get off quickly. Bucks rebounds, long-distance counterattack play neat, the score was quickly opened.

Came to the second quarter, the difference broke through the 10 point mark, then quickly toward the direction of 20 points, 30 points. In the fierce attack of the bucks and the roar of the Bucks' home audience, the eagles not only had more difficulties in scoring, but also the young people's psychological defense was gradually destroyed.

In the first half, the Bucks made use of the Hawks' mistakes to break through the 20 hurdles. In the interior, the letter brother's breakthrough and other people's impact made it difficult for the Hawks to resist.

Originally, Trey - Yang is not good at confrontation players, after half-time confrontation, his disadvantage is infinitely magnified. Half time, blowing Yang swallow seven mistakes, is the best proof of his lost.

So, only half of the ball time, the Bucks basically killed the suspense, into the second half, the game is more just training, just fighting for honor.
