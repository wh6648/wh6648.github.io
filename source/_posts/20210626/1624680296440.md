On June 26, according to reports from the US media, the Bulls' name Scotty Pippen and ESPN mouthpiece Stephen A. Smith had a verbal fight on social media today.

A day ago, Pippen's comments were refuted by the nets superstar Kevin Durant. Today, Pippen and a-smith are fighting again

Previously, in a program, a-smith talked about Michael Jordan, LeBron James and KD. A-smith said: "in addition to technique, body and player, mentality is also a kind of talent. Jordan didn't form a group when he failed. This is the point that he is better than James and KD."

Pippen said on social media that "@ a-smith, LeBron won an NBA championship without any help."

A-smith immediately replied, "with all due respect, this is ridiculous. The heat have Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, the Cavaliers have Carey Owen and Kevin love, and the Lakers have Anthony Davis. You (Pippen) are a six time champion. You can play basketball. Why do you say that? "

Pippen responded, "2016, of course, my God... Is there any other star around LeBron in 2016?"

Then Pippen tweeted back, "I'm so focused on launching my whisky, I'm confused. What I want to say is 2015. You are right. Thank @ a-smith for his criticism and correction! "
