June 26 news, ESPN famous reporter Jackie macmullan recently said that superstar Kevin Durant wants to win three championships in the Brooklyn basketball nets, such a report makes Durant very unhappy, he refuted this statement on twitter.

"I think when talking to him (Durant), his real goal is to win three championships in Brooklyn." Jackie macmullan wrote.

Durant forwarded the tweet and retorted: "again, I won't even say that. It's not the way I speak at all. And Jackie macmullan and I didn't get to know each other and talk about my goals as a basketball player. She said it as if we were friends, but we were not

When people talk about him, especially when what these people say is not true, Durant becomes very sensitive. If he doesn't feel respected, he will immediately come forward to refute. Durant has just finished his first season with the Brooklyn nets. Due to injury, the big three nets were eliminated by bucks in the second round of the playoffs.
