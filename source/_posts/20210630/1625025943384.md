June 30 news, NBA season schedule is a very hot topic, due to the continuous injury, many players think it is from the intensive schedule. Although the number of matches has been reduced, the off-season has been shortened. LeBron James also criticized many injuries before the official season should not start too early, now NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has made a response. O'Neill said that NBA players like James have made so much money and so many people in the United States are unemployed that he should not complain so much.

"I speak for the health of all the players and I hate to see so many injuries at this time of the year. Sorry fans, I hope you can see your favorite players playing on the court. I know all that is about business, so don't tell me that. " James has previously criticized this season's tight schedule.

Today, O'Neill responded to James' remarks¡° You live in a world where more than 40 million people are unemployed. If I make 200 million dollars, you won't hear my complaints. I can play back-to-back in a row. I don't mean to care what other people say, but for me personally, I won't find excuses or complain, because people in real life work harder. What we have to do is train two hours a day, then play two hours a night and make a lot of money... My thinking process is a little different O'Neill said.

It is worth mentioning that after James criticized the league schedule too tight, NBA spokesman Mike bass immediately responded. Buss said the injury rate this season is almost the same as that in 2019-20, while the chances of starters and all stars missing Games due to injuries are similar to those in the past three seasons.
