In terms of paper strength, the eagles and bucks are no longer at the same level. However, it was unexpected that in the first quarter, the eagles were full of fighting spirit. Bogdan Bogdanovic, Schulte, Luwei and Capella took turns to score, which quickly set off a climax and confused the bucks.

Obviously, the bucks are not well prepared for the change of the eagles. They still adopt the strategy of "taking me as the main player" to deal with it, but ignore the difference between Rowe and Yang in the style of playing and the characteristics of leading the team. And the Bucks' carelessness also spread to the defensive end.

Throughout the first half, the Bucks were suppressed by their opponents in rebounding and scoring. In addition to the awesome starting of the Hawks, young people such as Okungu and redash were also activated. What's more, as a top team, the Bucks were embarrassed to score 0 in nearly three minutes before half-time.

As a result, after Yi Bian, the buck paid a heavy price for his laziness.

Three quarters to 7:16, letter brother in a defense Capella, leg sprain angle. After that, he fell to the ground in pain and limped back to the dressing room with the help of his brother.

Although, a few minutes later, the letter brother himself back to the bench, but after a short trial, he returned to the dressing room again, disappointed to announce his retirement. After the letter retired from the game, the Bucks were completely flustered, and how could the eagles miss such an opportunity? Therefore, with the concerted efforts of a group of artillery men from the outside line, they played a new climax, leading by 25 points at the end of the third quarter, killing the suspense of victory and defeat completely.

And with the letter brother's injury, the Bucks' next series tour is also shrouded in a huge shadow, after the game, the letter will be on the stage? What's the extent of his knee injury? Once the letter brother is sure not to fight, what should the buck do?
