After seven out in the first round of the playoffs, the inside of the lone ranger suddenly changed. The speed of the change and the thoroughness of the personnel change were unexpected

Who would have thought that the lone ranger, who has always been known for his low profile and stability, would suddenly break up the iron triangle of the management in this hot and dry June. What's more, the one who (according to the rumor) forced away two meritorious figures, coach Carlisle and general manager Nelson Jr., turned out to be a figure that we had never heard of before, hararabos walgaris.

Walgaris was hired by the lone ranger in 2018, when he was the team's chief data analyst. It seems that there is a big gap between this position and the real top management. It also seems that Kuban's appreciation and reuse of walgaris is only limited to some empty consultant level. It seems that until the "earthquake" occurred, walgaris has always been a shadow hidden behind the boss Kuban.

However, more than half a month ago, Tim Cato, a senior reporter who has been covering the lone ranger competition for many years, revealed a series of unknown secrets. According to his report, before he came to the lone ranger, walgaris was a famous gambler. He had a smart brain, but his reputation was not good.

And the gambler's nature also makes walgaris not content with his work when he is a lone ranger. According to the tip, over the past two years, walgaris frequently intervened in the operation of the team, covering everything from player trading, draft selection to signing. He even extended his "magic claw" to the bench and began to instruct Carlisle.

As soon as this article was published, there was an uproar in the NBA circle. In order to calm down the incident, Kuban came out to spray Kato angrily and denied the accusation in the article.

But just a few days later, little Nelson and Carlisle resigned one after another, but Kuban's sophistry broke. Facts have proved that Cato's article is highly reliable, and the quick break between Nelson and Kasai and the lone ranger also shows that their conflicts with the team have been deeply rooted

It is undeniable that in Cato's article, it is indeed mentioned that some specific operations are directly related to walgaris. For example, the lone ranger picked two newcomers, Josh green and Tyrell Terry, at last year's draft conference. It is said that they were inspired by walgaris. As a result, these two rookies have not been reused in the past season and have not made a name at all; For another example, Josh Richardson's deal is also driven by walgaris behind the scenes. However, Richardson's role gradually shrinks after he comes to the lone ranger, and he can only become a substitute in the playoffs. In addition, walgaris also has disputes with the coaching staff, and even conflicts with the star Luca dongqiqi.

But in this regard, some people can't help wondering, as a mere data consultant, a man in the corner of the team, does walgaris really have such great energy? If we go back to the cause from the result, many things seem reasonable; But if we put the whole event in a larger context and on a longer time line, some details will not be so logical.

Obviously, there is a greater driving force behind the change of the top management of the lone ranger, and with such great energy to promote this matter and complete the task in a short time, the most reasonable person can only be and will only be one person - the boss of the team, Mark Cuban. As for the so-called walgaris, it may be just a pawn in Kuban's plan.

It is undeniable that as a manager who has been in the team for 24 years, Nelson Jr. has devoted the best years of his life to Dallas. Here, he won a high reputation and helped the team get the only championship trophy in the history of the team. He was recognized by the fans and highly trusted by Dirk Nowitzki, the last generation king of the team.

But frankly speaking, since winning the championship in 2011, the lone ranger has spent most of his time eating his old bread. In the past 10 years, every off-season, their recruitment of superstars failed. Howard, Deron and little Jordan, who were not the number one players in the market at that time, did not take Dallas as the first choice for signing. It is true that three years ago, Dong Qiqi's joining added a brilliant stroke to Nelson's poor operation report card. But in these three years, the lone ranger's action of building a lineup around Luca is still too conservative, and the effect is hard to say ideal.

Similar problems also appear in the coach Carlisle, although, since 2008, Carlisle has been at the helm of the team, but also for the lone ranger to win the championship. However, as a complete control maniac, Kasai has had too much friction with (the so-called privilege) stars in his coaching career. Even if the team has such a brilliant talent as Dong Qiqi, card Shuai has to give in, but between the overall tactics and the value of the star, his trade-off is rigid and unsatisfactory.

Kuban may have discovered these problems for a long time, but the reason why all the contradictions were put on the table this summer is that a special time is coming.

In the off-season, Dong Qiqi will be one of the first stars in the 2018 new generation to get the renewal license. Without too much consideration, as long as the signing door is open, the lone ranger will offer him a super top salary at the first time. And because Dong Qiqi has been selected for a while in the past two years, he will also become the first rookie in NBA history who immediately gets more than 200 million US dollars after his contract ends.

It seems that the parties involved do not have too many questions about the renewal of Dong Qiqi's contract. But Kuban clearly has more long-term plans and more worries. After all, in Kuban's mind, Dong Qiqi is determined to be the next Nowitzki. He not only hopes that Luca will stay, but also hopes that he will always wear the robe of the lone ranger. To achieve the latter, the lone ranger should not only give Luca the top salary, but also create a wonderful blueprint for him to win the championship for a long time in the future. Maybe that's the real reason why Kuban let little Nelson and Carlisle go
