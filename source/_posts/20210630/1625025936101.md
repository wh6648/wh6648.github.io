On June 30, Magic Johnson talked about the reasons for the early exit of the Lakers this season when he participated in ESPN. He believed that the failure of the Lakers was not only due to injuries, but also related to the unreasonable structure of the lineup and the incorrect roles played by James and Davis.

After a season full of bad luck, the Lakers bid farewell to the playoffs. Thick eyebrow due to injury can not stay on the field for a long time, James's strength did not return to 100%. When asked what James and thick eyebrow need to do to fix the problem of the Lakers, the magician gave his own opinion.

"Put a shooter next to James and thick eyebrow. At the same time, the thick eyebrow wants to hit the center more. You can't allow thick eyebrows to say, "I don't want to play center." It's no good. First of all, you're a Laker player and we want to try to win. Personally, I think I will let James reduce his work a little. We are asking him to take on too much now. You can't ask James to be a point guard, which means you have to train hard, you have to attack with the ball, let everyone participate in the attack, then when can James rest? You have to understand that we want James to be strong in the playoffs, so let someone else take on some tasks

Although magic has been out of the Lakers for several years, everything has not been going well in his tenure. However, his words are theoretically correct, and have been discussed and practiced within the Lakers.

At this point, there is ample evidence that the Lakers will perform better when Nongmei is the center. However, the reason why he doesn't play center often is the same as the reason why magic doesn't want James to play point guard again. The Lakers try to protect his health in the most important playoffs.
