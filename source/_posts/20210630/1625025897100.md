Tatum spent a career high year in the Celtic 2020-21 season. As the engine of the team, he averaged 26.4 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game, which set a new career high for him. But that's not enough to make the young star the NBA's best team.

Tatum missed out on a $33 million prize that would have come with the recognition because he was not selected for the NBA best team.

"I know that I should have been selected, just in terms of my performance throughout the season "I mean, there was 33 million, and obviously it's going to make everyone feel that way," Tatum said on a podcast

"I'm not really upset about losing the prize," Tatum added. "I just feel that the way I play, everything I've done, I feel that being in the best team should be a problem that doesn't need to be thought about. I just feel more frustrated about it."

At the same time, Tatum also put forward a proposal to amend the subjectivity and preference of the media in voting¡° I think there's something they really need to change - it's a kind of opinion base. 100 media members have the right to vote. What's the standard? Is it certain how many games a player needs to play? Need to play in the playoffs? According to your position, you should average a certain number of points. "
