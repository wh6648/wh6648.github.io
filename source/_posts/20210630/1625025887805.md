On June 30, the Laker's Schroeder will become an unrestricted free agent this summer, and he expects to get a big salary.

According to U.S. media reports, German Basketball Federation vice chairman Amin Andres revealed that the ball control guard hopes to reach a $100 million to $120 million contract in the free market. That's why Schroeder didn't represent Germany in the Olympics this summer, because the amount of insurance for his future contract is too expensive for the German Basketball Federation.

Schroeder was one of the candidates for the best sixth man in the thunder last season and the first in the Lakers this season. His three-point goal this year is a bit erratic, but he has played well most of the time, especially in the weeks when James was absent with an ankle injury. This season, Schroeder averaged 32.7 minutes per game, with 15.4 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.8 assists.
