On June 30, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely. The Atlanta Hawks beat the Milwaukee Bucks 110-88 to draw the total score 2-2¡° "Hawk king" Trey Yang was absent due to injury, but Lu Wei, the "ace substitute" who replaced Trey Yang and started for the first time in his playoff career, made 7 of 9 shots, scored 21 points, 5 rebounds and 8 assists.

Speaking of Louis Williams, the first thought is "the best sixth man", he is a substitute who can hand over star level data. If Lu Wei has the experience of starting in the regular season, then the playoffs for him is absolutely: the first time for a girl to get on the sedan chair.

As Trey young suffered ankle sprain in the third game, MRI results showed that he had a bone bruise in his right foot, so the Hawks core decided not to play in the fourth game, Luwei instead of Trey Yang starting, this is also the "ace substitute" career for the first time in the playoffs.

Despite his "zero experience" in the playoffs, Dewey is a veteran with 15 years of NBA experience.

After the start of the game, Dewey quickly became the core of the Hawks' attack. He played for 16 minutes in the first two quarters and made four shots, including one three-point shot and four free throws. The shooting rate is 100%, there are no mistakes, and there are three rebounds and one assists and one steals.

The most important thing is that Lu Wei led the eagles to lead the bucks by 13 points 51-38 after the end of the first two quarters. It is estimated that even Trey Yang didn't expect this score.

After the half-time, when the Bucks started to clamp down on Lu Wei, the experienced Lu Wei took the initiative to adjust his attack strategy. On the offensive side, he took the initiative to create opportunities for his teammates. In the first eight minutes of the third quarter, he sent out four assists. Although he missed one free throw, Luwei continued to hit 100% in his personal sports.

After leading the team to play a 12-2 attack wave, Rowe helped the eagles lead the bucks by 20 points 74-54.

Dewey missed the basket in his seventh shot, which is a relative pity for him. However, at the end of the third quarter, he led the team to establish a 25 point lead, which is the most gratifying thing for Dewey.

Three clocks off work, to help the Hawks pull the total score to 2-2¡° "Trump substitute" Lu Wei shot 7 for 9, scored 21 points, 5 rebounds and 8 assists, is definitely the first meritorious official, and Lu Wei's excellent performance also won precious rest time for "Hawk king" Trey young.
