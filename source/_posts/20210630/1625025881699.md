On June 30, the NBA playoffs continued. In the fourth game of the Eastern Conference finals, the eagles led the bucks by 2-1. The lagging Eagles also damaged the main general Trey young. However, facing the eagles who were short of major general, the Bucks were in a disadvantage and were taken the lead by the eagles.

In the first half of the game, the Bucks' big three didn't feel good. Letterman only made 3 of 7 shots and missed one free throw in three times. Middleton made 3 of 10 shots and hollerdy made 2 of 7 shots. On the contrary, Tucker became the highlight of the Bucks' attack.

In the first quarter of the game, Tucker made a three-point pass from hollerdy and scored a breakthrough goal when the Bucks fell into a long passive situation. At this time, the eagles have got 10 points. Before the Bucks hit the three-point mark in Tucker, only huoledi broke through the layup and scored.

5:13, Middleton snatched the three-point ball thrown by Letterman, and tucker scored the layup. 3 minutes 14 seconds, huoledi assists tucker to throw three points again, at this time the Bucks have narrowed the difference to 3 points.

In the first half, he made three of five shots and hit two of four three-point shots. However, Tucker's two three-point shots were all in the first quarter. Tucker's performance in the second quarter of the game was mediocre. In sports, he only had one three-point shot. The offensive end was not as brilliant as in the first quarter. In the last 2.9 seconds of the first half, the Bucks gave Tucker the choice of the last shot, but Tucker forced his three-point shot to be blocked by his opponent.

In the second half, Letterman began to feel warm, but other players didn't give the core support firepower, and Tucker's three-point ball in the first half was just a flash.

In the third quarter, Tucker's empty cut layup was blocked by Collins, and Tucker's three-point also missed in 5:14. At this time, the Bucks were 15 points behind the Hawks. The role players didn't throw the ball in, which was one of the reasons why the Bucks were behind.

In the third quarter of the Bucks game, the role players did not score any points. The first five players except Lopez scored three points, only the big three scored.

In 7 minutes and 14 seconds, Connaughton took the place of Letterman. He didn't play the role of his running ability without the ball and outside line projection. In 4 minutes and 16 seconds, Portis missed a breakthrough hook after he went on the court, and there was no other scoring performance. 2:24, Tigh and Forbes on the court, Tigh breakthrough layup does not enter, Forbes did not hand.

Forbes, Connaughton and Tucker, three open pitchers are the wind vane of the Bucks' attack. If they can't hit the goal, it also proves that the Bucks have fallen into the scoring shortage of stagnant attack. The Bucks who have no space and no three points are bound by their own cocoons.

At the end of the game, the main center Lopez made 3 of 5 shots. Although Lopez played an important role in protecting the frame, he had only 7 points. It was very difficult to help the Bucks win when the big three lost their hand. Other role players did not stand up for the main force to share the pressure, Tucker shot 3 of 7, sports goals in the first half. Portis scored 7 points on 3-for-9, Connaughton scored 3 points on 1-for-3, and Forbes scored 6 points on 2-for-6. Some of their goals were in the fourth quarter, where they were behind by a big score.

At this time, the Bucks can only rely on Middleton's singles, but Middleton's singles is not always brilliant, and it is difficult to rely on Middleton to take over the game after brother Letterman leaves.

In the end, the eagles beat the Bucks 110-88, and the letter brother was suspected to be injured in the game. If he is absent from the future game, if the Bucks' role players still feel depressed, the Bucks' road to the finals may be very tortuous.
