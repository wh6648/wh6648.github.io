Durant is becoming a panacea, can be replaced can be the main force, can be defensive offensive state, is the key to the basketball net power in the playoffs. On April 30, 2021, the Nets beat the Pacers 130-113. Durant scored 42 points in 16 of 24 shots and sent out 10 assists. It is still a very typical game with Durant shooting as a textbook.

Owen did not play in this game, so it was a game led by Durant alone. The result was that the net had led to nearly 20 points at the beginning of the second quarter, which was probably not thought by everyone. The whole leading process, Durant won 8 points and nothing terrible is Durant in this period sent out five consecutive assists. In the sixth minute of the second quarter, Durant broke through and attracted four people's attention. As a result, he passed the ball one by one to assist his team-mates in the bottom line.

Of course, his unsettled misplaced shooting ability is the real killer. In fact, Durant was the "king of the shots" in those years during the warrior period, taking all sizes within 16 feet, leaving all teams helpless. In the third minute of the second quarter, Durant began to attack in the bottom corner, and directly completed the double hand slam dunk with one step of holding the ball, followed by a successful spider man style covering defense. Durant played a light role in the half time, but suppressed the Pacers.

Durant had 12 points and 6 assists at half-time, but he didn't make any effort at all. The only thing he didn't do well was his three-point shooting of 0-2. You know, Durant has already made his career's most ruthless three-point shooting rate of 47% this season, ranking fifth in the league. As soon as the third quarter began, Durant started to fight on the outside line. After a three-point hit, he made a foul with a three-point ball. As soon as the Pacers caught up with the single digits, they directly reached the 18 point gap.

In just a few minutes, Durant led the team to stop the Pacers twice, and even the coach of the concession Pacers complained about the referee's technical fouls because of his dissatisfaction. The third quarter became Durant's shooting performance. With continuous shooting, the walkers relied too much on and superstitious in joint defense, giving the nets too many chances to shoot three points. Durant seized such a loophole and finished a fatal blow in the third quarter. 3 minutes in the third quarter, Durant shot 2 + 1 from the bottom corner, making the net still control 20 points. A minute later, Durant changed to the left corner, the opponent was almost hanging on him, but Durant remained unchanged. In just five minutes, Durant used five different positions of unsolved shots, stopped the opponent twice, and blasted 10 points in a row to bury the opponent's defense.

In the third quarter, the net basically determined the victory, although the fourth quarter Pacers once caught up with the single digits, but Durant returned to the field and began to harvest the game again. In the fifth minute of the fourth quarter, Durant's assists kept up with shamette, who made a rare gliding smash after catching the ball, followed by a backward shot, leading by 10 points again, so there was no suspense in the game. In the end, Durant's single core team swept the Pacers in the season.
