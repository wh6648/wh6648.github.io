It was reported on April 30 that the Suns beat the Clippers 109-101 yesterday. After this battle, the Suns' record rose to 44-18, locking in the playoffs ahead of time. This is the Suns after 11 years into the playoffs, the last time into the playoffs in 2010, when Steve Nash led.

"It feels great," said Devon Booker, who is experiencing the playoffs for the first time in six seasons. "It's a long process and I've been waiting for five years for that."

Just like the whole season, Chris Paul was the main reason the Suns won the playoffs. Today, ESPN reporter Jackie macmullan wrote a long article describing the changes Paul brought to the team after he was traded by the Rockets, joined the thunder and Suns successively.

Paul admitted that he saw coming to Houston in 2017 as his last chance to fight for the championship. After putting on the rocket war robe, Paul thought that their relations will take root.

"I brought about 15 people there (Houston)," he said Paul said this included his wife, his children, his brother, nanny, trainer, bodyguard and cook. But Paul's tenure with the rockets was short and ruthless, and eventually he was traded to thunder.

When Paul's friend and former teammate Matt Barnes learned about the deal, he said, "Damn it, it's a cold end."

Paul refrained from expressing his feelings of betrayal and shock after he left Houston. "There is no such thing as' bad luck for me 'and no one wants to listen to it." Paul said.

Paul's rational attitude towards the sport has always been beyond reproach. The problem is that he is stubborn, which occasionally makes the coach and teammates feel unhappy. As Barnes said, it has become "an acquired habit".

"I like playing with Chris (Paul), but you have to have a strong stomach." Barnes said.

At first glance, it's like the worst day of a long and proud career to be thrown from the competitive rockets to the thunder team who seems to win the lottery. In thunder's crucial season, the league's general managers were looking for two things: is Paul willing to listen to these young people? Can he inject some energy into his steps?

"I had doubts," said one of the league's general managers, "but he (Paul) did both."

Usually, when a player is traded, he will receive a call from the new owner immediately, but Paul didn't get the news from thunder coach Sam Presti immediately. He knew that he might not have to report to the thunder, especially when the rumours of his transfer to the heat were being spread wildly. One day passed, two days passed. On the third day, Paul called his agent and said, "give me Presti's call. I'm going to meet my new teammates. I'm going to call them."

Sources said the dialogue between Paul and Presti was fruitful. The deal is simple: as an experienced veteran, as long as Paul is willing to help the team's young players¡° Like everyone else, Chris (Paul) takes time to process the deal. It happened all of a sudden and it wasn't perfect for him Presti said.

There were also Kyrgyz Alexander and experienced Dennis Schroeder on the thunder point guard list, so Paul didn't need to hold the ball for nearly half of the time. The thunder trainer even made four different and detailed season plans for Paul, one of which is that the back-to-back game can be rotated¡° Forget that, "Paul told them." I won't miss so many games. "

Alexander and Paul are inseparable, but Paul emphasizes to establish contact with the experienced Steven Adams¡° Out of respect. " In response, Paul said, "that's his team."

Alexander is a regular guest of Paul's family. They watch many NBA games together. Every moment is a teaching opportunity: how to grasp the time, when to seize

"It's a little thing that other guys ignore, how to get one step ahead of the opponent and reach a certain position, if you foul at the end of the game, these are all things Chris (Paul) can do in his sleep, he has all the knowledge." Alexander said.

The thunder of "Reconstruction" suddenly announced the end of all this at a critical moment. After 16 months at Thunder, Paul was traded to Phoenix. At the Suns, Paul joined a shaky, dysfunctional team - but with talented young players and a perfect eight game winning streak in Orlando last summer.

Andrew Aton remembers the first day he met Paul, when he said he had experienced a "CP3 mentality.". It was just before the start of a match training, Paul stopped the team¡° That's why it's useless for you to do that, "Paul said, seizing the 7-foot-high Eaton shirt." you need to stand here, not there. I told you before that your position is useless, that's not right. "

When asked which time Paul scolded him the most, Aton said with a smile that he didn't even remember¡° Well, if you don't catch his pass, I'll hear the shouting. To be honest, there's so much yelling that I'm not even sure which one is the best Said Aton.

Paul said that Aton reminds him of his former team friend Andre Jordan in the Clippers¡° He (Aton) is a child who likes to play, and his life in the dressing room is totally different from that on the court, just like de Andre (JORDAN). So it's great to see him improve Said Paul.

But that doesn't mean that Paul is relaxed about Aton, who is only 22 years old and hard to maintain stability, which is the source of their constant dialogue. Suns General Manager James Jones has known Paul for more than ten years. When he got Paul, Jones knew exactly what he would get.

"I'm always obsessed with the concept of being too tough on men. If being tough means telling your teammates that they screwed up because they didn't carry out the game correctly, I really don't think it's a problem." "Now you know, you can simply say, 'Chris, I hear what you're saying, but don't talk to me that way. If you talk to me that way, it will resonate better with me,'" Jones says

Barnes also believes that the problem often lies in the way of communication, rather than the message¡° Even the veteran, "Barnes said," Chris would say something to Blake (Griffin) or de Andrea (JORDAN), and they would roll their eyes, so I went to them and said, "I think that's what Chris wants to tell you."

However, the sun's staff pointed out that Paul has changed from a perfectionist who is always pestering about things to a milder veteran. When Aton didn't perform well in the fourth quarter due to physical problems, Paul didn't yell at him. Instead, he yelled, "Hey, de Andrea, you're not tired, go on!"

Just 21 months after the Rockets gave up Paul, he led the Suns into the playoffs 11 years later. Paul transformed the young team into a disciplined and powerful team, and created the best away record in the NBA (20-8). They recently ended the Knicks' 9-game winning streak.

Aton said in an interview that he did not need a kind and gentle leader¡° I need someone like him to push me to my full potential Said Aton. Aton talked endlessly about the benefits of Paul's guidance and so on.

"People have the idea that when you're with someone shouting, the relationship is over. They have never seen the players talking in the dressing room or the encouraging messages sent to each other by their teammates Said Paul.

In response, Aton explained: "Chris always talks to me. We have a group of soldiers in our team. This kind of emotion is very strong and contagious."

Aton said Paul's frankness gave him the courage to respond when necessary. If he didn't get the ball after a pick and roll, he would shout to Paul, "come on, man! Pass the ball higher

At the end of a recent suns game, Paul warned his teammates to defend well during the pause¡° You've got to hold back the people you're facing. " Cried Paul.

Aton immediately responded, "yes, CP, you're right, but you have to start with yourself." When he was young, Paul would immediately retort, but now the veteran just nods and goes on the court.

When asked if his character became gentle with age, Paul replied, "absolutely." But a few seconds later, Paul continued, "I don't know, but I'm still me. I still have high expectations of myself."

Although it remains to be seen whether Paul's career in the Suns is perfect and extraordinary enough, here Paul is closer to his family. He also likes the young suns. He doesn't apologize for challenging his teammates to become better. He just wants to help them grow. Aton said that Paul is the lifeblood of the team, is their backer.

"To be honest?" "I'm honored Paul yells at me a lot," Aton said
