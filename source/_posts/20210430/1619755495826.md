On April 30, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued, with the Rockets beating the Bucks 143-136 at home.

This battle, the young Rockets star Kevin Porter 26 in 16, slashed 50 points, 5 rebounds, 11 assists, positive and negative value + 19 the highest, played an incredible game.

Home against the eastern top teams bucks, originally, theoretically, the Rockets are not the slightest chance.

But this game, because of one person's play, the balance of victory and defeat was completely reversed, and the Rockets also got the most incredible victory of the season.

As a matter of fact, little Kevin Porter made some surprises when he first entered the Rockets' roster. However, after that, the rest of the city lost in a row, as they completely sit the League penultimate first, Porter's state also declined.

In the last five games, little Porter only scored 20 + in one game. Last week, Stirling Brown of the Rockets encountered a vicious fight in Miami. Little Porter was also involved in the fight in order to rescue his teammates and became the center of the incident.

But, a series of changes, did not kill little Potter's fighting spirit, today's game against the Bucks, his state recovery, and burst out amazing scoring firepower.

You know, this game against little Potter, but one of the league's best backcourt defenders Zhu huoledi, this man had in the playoffs, lilard limit to despair.

However, the newborn calf is not afraid of tigers, but little Potts is not afraid of Holliday, and he has advantages over Holliday in height, arm spread and strength.

As a result, almost from the beginning of the game, this group of pairs fell into a one-sided. Little Porter changes his moves to attack huoledi. Whether it's a strong attack under the basket, or a three-point retreat, or a wonderful pass after shaking, he can always get it easily.

In the first half of the game, the development of the situation was relatively stable, but in the third quarter, little Porter got 15 points and led the team to set off a wave of counterattack. During this period, huoledi even adopted the close pressing strategy to him, but he was still shot by little Porter in the corner without any space.

In the whole game, the Bucks scored 30 + and Huo ledi also got 29 points and 10 assists. However, these data, in front of little Porter's output of 50 points, 11 assists, 5 rebounds and 9 three-point goals, became dull.

50 points is the single game record of little Porter's career. He has also become the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points before the age of 21. The other three players are LeBron James (twice), Jennings and Devon Booker.

In addition, little Porter also became the second Rockets player to get 50 points + 10 assists after harden. The 20-year-old Porter also surpassed LeBron James to become the youngest player with 50 points and 10 assists in a single game in NBA history.

A few days ago, rockets boss Tilman feldita said in an interview that he was optimistic about the future of Porter, because he believed that little porter had shown similar or even better talent than (the same age) harden at the age of less than 21.

If we say that for this young man who was (almost) picked up from the Cavaliers, many people questioned him before, but through this game, little Porter proved to everyone how high his talent limit is.

After the game, in an interview, Rockets coach Stephen - Silas said excitedly, "I am proud of him (Porter), this season we rarely have such an exciting moment, tonight I am very proud of this child."
