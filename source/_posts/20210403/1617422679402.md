On April 3, according to Chris crouse, Bradley bill is the star of the Washington Wizards and enjoys privileges similar to LeBron James.

Due to the poor record of the wizards, the rumors of Bill's trade once caused heated discussion. It is reported that most teams in the League will be interested in bill, even including the top teams such as the Lakers and the Clippers. In fact, Bill didn't formally and publicly ask for a deal. In an interview, bill also reiterated that he would tide over the difficulties with the wizard. In fact, last season, bill was the league's top trading player, but Bill and the team's general manager refuted the rumor many times. During the off-season, the Wizards repeatedly declared that bill was not for sale. They finally got Russell Westbrook from the Rockets with John wall.

Today's reporter Chris crouse reported that bill is the leading star of the wizards, and he has obviously been granted the same level of privilege as LeBron James.

"The wizards will continue to build their lineup around Bradley bill and Russell Westbrook. The management of the wizards will continue to seek the advice of bill in major decisions, which Bill values very much." NBA reporter Chris crouse wrote in the report.

"It's a LeBron James type privilege." One person familiar with the matter said.

Bill, 27, is one of the most impressive players in the league. Many teams want to take him away from Washington, but the marksman insists on staying with the wizards and wants to help the team become a competitor. So far this season, bill has averaged 31.3 points, 5.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. It is worth mentioning that bill was selected into the All-Star starting line-up for the first time in his career this year. His fans' votes, media votes and players' votes ranked first in the eastern backcourt, and his 3485051 fans' votes were higher than the total fans' votes in the previous eight seasons.
