Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle has tested positive for the new coronavirus, which prevented him from attending today's match between the New York Knicks and the Madison Square Garden coaching team.

Carlisle, 61, said in an interview that the results of the new coronavirus test were "unexpected" because he received the new coronavirus vaccine in January. "It's possible and hopefully false positive," Carlisle said in an interview at the New York team hotel. "It may seem like a mistake, but for some reasons, I'm in the NBA health and safety agreement."

Carlisle said he didn't have any symptoms. "I feel great. I went to the gym this morning, but it's just one of those situations. We all have to be careful and be alert." Carlisle said,.

Lone ranger assistant Jamal Mosley will replace Carlisle on the sidelines. Speaking of Mosley, Carlisle said: "for a long time, I have been a loyal supporter of him. I have been very supportive of him in all the interviews in the past few years. I think it will be an opportunity for him to show his ability and he is ready for it. Our people will do their best for him. "
