It was reported on April 3 that recently, ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith and Washington Wizards star Russell Westbrook had a fierce quarrel. Today, Shaquille Olney talked about this matter in the "inside the NBA" program of Yahoo Sports. Olney said that the commentators didn't mean to target Westbrook. Many great players didn't win the Championship, But that doesn't mean they don't deserve all the love and admiration in their careers.

Stephen-a-smith previously said on the program "first take" that he respected Westbrook very much, and praised the latter's achievements on the field and what he did for the community. However, a-smith later said that the data of Westbrook is no longer important, and whether he can win the championship is the most important.

Westbrook also immediately responded: "the championship will not change my life. I won the championship before I entered the NBA. I grew up on the street and I am a champion. NBA championship is not necessarily a necessity. I know many champions never do anything for the community or the people in the world. One thing I won't allow to happen again is to let people make up stories and constantly talk about me with a bunch of rubbish for no reason

Today, Olney talked about it in "inside the NBA". Olney said that every great player in the NBA will experience this situation, and Westbrook is no exception.

"In this industry, there will be a lot of people saying a lot, which is an unfortunate part of this industry. When you are a great player, you play great data, but people always say, "wait, wait until you get a championship." if you can't get a championship, then the data is not a great achievement. " Olney said.

"All great people go through this," Olney said of Westbrook's criticism for not winning the championship

At the same time, Olney also made it clear that many great players have not won the championship, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve all the love and admiration in their career.

"You can't tell me that Allen Iverson is not one of the greatest point guards, you can't say that John Stockton is not one of the greatest point guards, you can't say that Karl Malone and Charles Barkley are not the greatest power forwards, that's an unfortunate part of the NBA." Olney said.

O'Neill said Westbrook was not the first person to be criticized, and certainly not the last. "Everyone has to go through it. It's not just about Westbrook. All the great players, everyone goes through it. We all think he's a great player O'Neill said.
