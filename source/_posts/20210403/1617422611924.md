On April 3, reports from US media said that Kevin Durant, the leading star of the nets, was fined $50000 by the League for a verbal fight with actor Michael lapaport on social media.

Earlier this week, lapaport posted a screenshot of his and KD's private messages on social media. In the picture, the two spoke fiercely. Durant used insulting words many times, some of which also involved homophobia and discrimination against women.

In an interview on Friday, KD officially apologized, saying: "I'm very sorry to let you see that I used such words and said those dirty words. This is not what I want you to see or hear, and I don't want to leave such an impression on you. I hope I can overcome it and get back on the pitch as soon as possible

Durant has been out of action since February 14 because of a hamstring injury, during which time he missed the all star game.

In an interview this week, Nets coach Steve Nash said: "I don't think he will play the next two games (bulls and Knicks), but he is improving and everything is going in the direction we want, so he won't be (absent) for long."

So far this season, KD has played 19 regular season games, averaging 35.7 minutes, 29.0 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.4 blocks.
