On June 18, the NBA playoffs continued. The nets lost 89-104 to the bucks and were tied 3-3 in the series.

In this game, Griffin made 4-for-8 shots, scored 12 points, 6 rebounds, 2 steals and 1 blocks, and 12 points became the highest score of the net except Durant harden. The low performance of role players also directly led to the failure of the net to end the series in the away game.

For the nets, Owen and harden's injuries to a large extent affect the trend of the series, although Durant's strong outbreak led the team to win the Tianwang mountain, but from the strength and personnel neat situation, the bucks is undoubtedly the more dominant side, which puts forward higher requirements for the role of the nets players.

After the start of the game, the nets entered a very slow state, and there were continuous mistakes at the beginning, which led to the situation falling into a passive position. The difference directly came to double digits. When it was difficult, Griffin hit the key three points to stabilize the situation, and directly stopped the Bucks to help the nets narrow the difference. On the defensive side, in the face of the letter brother who is more determined to attack the interior line, Griffin can only do his best to make restrictions, and in the case of the shortage of rebounds, it is very important to let himself not be troubled by foul trouble, Griffin has well protected himself, so that he can stay on the court for a longer time.

Although Griffin needs to use his own projection ability to help the nets open space from the strategic level of the nets, Griffin didn't force a three-point shot in the key chasing stage of the second quarter. However, his enthusiasm was perfectly reflected in the second quarter. First, he covered the ball and hit the layup. Then he snatched Middleton, pushed up the counterattack and hit the layup. Next, he grabbed the front court rebounds on the heads of Letterman and Middleton, and made a good layup to help the net narrow the difference to 4 points.

Yi Bian fought again. Griffin didn't have a good hand in the third quarter. He didn't hit twice, and the free throw made under the impact basket only hit once. However, he still completed the task of opening the space and helped Durant to open the space. With Durant's outbreak, the net continued to close the score.
