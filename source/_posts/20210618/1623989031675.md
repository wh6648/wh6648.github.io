On June 18, the NBA playoffs continued. The eastern semi-finals basketball net and bucks series entered the sixth game. The 3-2 leading basketball net went to the road game to continue to fight bucks. Finally, the basketball net lost 89-104 to bucks, and the score was tied 3-3. Durant scored 32 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists in 15 of 30 shots.

In the last battle of Tianwang mountain, Durant played a super game, becoming the first person to score 45 + 15 + 10 in NBA playoffs. In this game, Durant's state is still continuing. At the beginning of the game, he first created opportunities for his teammates to pass the ball. Unfortunately, the whole team could not open the situation. In the first four minutes, only his one stop shot scored. Seeing that the difference was opened, Durant finally began to attack himself.

However, he failed to score three points twice in a row, and the Bucks expanded their opening advantage to 18-5. After the pause, Durant finally hit a single turn over jumper, and then turned low to get rid of the two handed fly button. Under his leadership, the nets gradually walked out of the difficult situation of the opening. However, the Bucks further strengthened their defense against him. After missing two difficult midshots in a row, Durant first broke through Lopez to score, then broke through the letter brother to score, and assisted green to score three points.

In the first quarter, Durant scored 10 points in 5 of 9 shots, becoming the most reliable offensive firepower point of the net. This also further attracted the strength of the Bucks' defense. In the second quarter, he would encounter pinch, CO defense and containment from time to time, forcing him to give the ball as much as possible, and his two strong attacks were fruitless. After he left the game, harden led the team to catch up with the score gradually, and after he came back, he made a three-point jump. However, after the high-intensity defense, Durant missed two three points in a row and missed two free throws. Before the end of the first half, the difference was pulled back to 11 points again.

Second quarter in the high-intensity defense, Durant only 6 for 1, the performance of a sudden decline. In the third quarter, Harris made a layup, followed by a quick stop and a steady jump shot. However, when the nets tried to catch up, Durant made mistakes one after another. He dribbled to break through and lost the ball. Then he was cut off.

However, he made a quick adjustment and opened the death singles mode. First, he hit a hard stop jump shot, followed by three consecutive back singles by Huo ledi. He hit two very difficult turn over jump shots. When he changed to tuck defense, Durant still turned around to attack again, and then finished the slam dunk after empty cutting. Under his continuous scoring, the net gradually approached the point difference. But Middleton's run of scoring gave the bucks a 6-0 lead of 11 points to finish the third quarter.

Durant got 12 points in the third quarter to help the nets keep up with the score. When the last point difference was pulled to 15 points, Durant made a three-point shot in time to stop bleeding. Although he missed three points later, he quickly made a strong breakthrough into the interior line, carried the defense, and assisted Harris with an empty cut. Under his leadership, the nets played a wave of 10-0 climax to catch up with the difference to 5 points.

However, it also became the last and the closest chance for the nets to win the game. The Bucks, led by the letter brother, quickly responded to a wave of 14-0 climax and directly expanded the difference by 19 points. Although Durant responded quickly with a breakthrough smash, he missed the ball again in the confrontation and failed to make a turn over jump shot. With Middleton playing 3 + 1, the difference was expanded to 21 points, and the game was completely out of suspense.

Although he lost the game, Durant still scored 32 points, 11 rebounds and 3 assists with 15-for-30 performance in the case of heavy defense, but he was unable to stand alone and finally lost.
