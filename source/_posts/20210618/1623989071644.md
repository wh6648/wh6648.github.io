June 18 news, ESPN famous reporter Adrian - wernalovsky in a podcast show revealed that the Suns guard Chris - Paul the most ideal situation is to only miss a Western Conference finals.

This week Paul triggered the alliance health and safety agreement. CP3 tested positive for the new crown, the source said. It is understood that Paul has been vaccinated before, so this makes the situation a little complicated. At this stage, Paul's state is an indefinite truce.

What the outside world is most concerned about is how many games Paul will be absent? After all, if the Suns don't have Paul, the overall strength will be greatly affected.

"At the moment, the ideal situation for the suns and Paul is that the jazz and Clippers play seven in the series, so that they will play until (local time) Sunday," Warsaw said. In this way, Paul may only miss one game

"Now Paul is being tested continuously," Warsaw continued. "We'll get more information over the weekend."

For Paul, this year's postseason trip is very bumpy. At the beginning, he suffered a shoulder injury, and now the new crown test is positive again. Paul, 36, has averaged 31.2 minutes in the playoffs this year, with 15.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 1.2 steals.
