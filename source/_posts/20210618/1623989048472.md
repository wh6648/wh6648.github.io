On June 18, the NBA playoffs continued. The eastern semi-final basketball net and bucks series entered the sixth game. The 3-2 leading basketball net went to the road game to continue to fight bucks. In the end, the basketball net lost 89-104 to bucks, and the big score was pulled to 3-3 level. Harden was completely invisible in the second half. He only shot 5 for 9 and got 16 points, 5 rebounds, 7 assists and 4 steals in the whole game.

In the eastern semi-finals of Tianwang mountain, harden played 45 minutes back, but did not show any good performance. Only one out of 10 shots got 5 points and 8 assists in the whole game. Obviously, harden is far from being at his best. Before the game, Nash also said, "I have no idea how harden will play in the next game, but I'm sure he will play more comfortably." However, in the game, it is obvious that harden is still worried, the desire to attack is not strong.

At the beginning of the game, harden made mistakes in passing the ball, dribbled the ball and was fouled by Middleton. In the case of scoring shortage in the team's start, when the Bucks hit the 10-2 start, harden finally hit the landmark three points in a row. After Durant's hand gradually warmed up, harden began to play for Durant in a row, and after steals, he assisted Griffin to make three points

In the second quarter, harden's desire to attack still seems not high. When he was pulled back to 13 points, harden raced into three points again against the letter brother's defense at the top of the arc, and then shot and snatched to break through. After that, he passed the ball in succession, especially after Durant left the court. First, harden passed the ball to help shamette make three fouls, three free throws and two free throws. Then he assisted brown to score three points. He also broke through Griffin's wonderful pass to score under the basket. After passing the ball in succession, harden broke through the throw and scored again, and then he hit three points against the letter, The nets went from 12 to 4.

However, harden, who scored 11 points in the second quarter, was quickly depressed in the second half. In the whole second half, he only missed two shots and only relied on the free throw to get 2 points without any performance. With 4:45 left in the fourth quarter, it was his three-point foul against Middleton that gave the latter 3 + 1. The Bucks expanded the difference to 21 points, completely interrupting Durant's final momentum of chasing points and completely destroying the hope of winning the nets.
