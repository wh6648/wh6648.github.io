On May 27, the Los Angeles Clippers suffered a huge crisis in the first round of the playoffs and lost to Dallas lone Rangers for two consecutive games, which made veteran Rajan Rondo very angry. According to Dallas Morning Post reporter Brad Townsend, Rondo yelled at coach Tyrone Lu and teammate Sergi Ibaka after the G2 series, and Ibaka also yelled back at the two time NBA champion.

In the second game of the series against the lone ranger, Coway Leonard scored 41 points, but it was a pity that he failed to help the Clippers to pass, and finally fell behind the lone ranger by 0-2. Rondo is not satisfied with this situation at all. They did not perform well in the match with the lone ranger, and the coach tyron Lu could not find an effective way to stop Luca donchic from playing. According to Brad Townsend, Rondo yelled at coach Tyrone Lu and teammate Ibaka after the G2 series, and Ibaka also yelled back at Rondo.

Obviously, as a veteran in the League for many years, Rondo knows how to win, but he didn't see that in the Clippers. This situation is likely to be worse than last season, when the clippers were upset by the nuggets for their 3-1 lead. At present, the clippers have lost two home games in a row, and then they are going to fight away. The experienced veteran is the leader the Clippers need to make a leap in the sport, but if the rest of the team don't agree, they won't be able to reach the level they need to win a championship. The Clippers also suffered a series of problems last year, which led to Harrell finally going to the Los Angeles Lakers and attacking his former club.
