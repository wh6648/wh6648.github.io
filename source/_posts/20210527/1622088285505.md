On May 27, NBA reporter Chris Broussard revealed in a famous program "undisputed" that it was true that the Clippers deliberately lost to avoid the Lakers.

"Everyone thinks we've made up the story that the Clippers deliberately lost to avoid the Lakers. Last week, I sent a message to someone who knew the situation, and I said, "I've always heard that the Clippers are deliberately losing to avoid the Lakers, and I absolutely don't believe that. That can't be true. " The person who knew the inside story replied to me, "absolutely true." And he didn't like to do that. He kept saying that there would be bad karma. So I believe they don't want to meet the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. I'm not saying they're afraid of the Lakers in the Western Conference finals, but for whatever reason, they don't want to meet them early. That's what I was told. This is one of them. " Chris Broussard said.

"Second, I don't think it's any different for the lone ranger. Dong Qiqi was asked by reporters after last night's match, "because the Clippers deliberately lost, do you have more motivation?" "I didn't know that until someone told me before G1," donchichi said. However, it's not an extra motivation. It doesn't matter much to me. " Broussard added.
