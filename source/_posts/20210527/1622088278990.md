On May 27, it was reported that Washington Wizards superstar Russell Westbrook was attacked by a Philadelphia 76ers fan with popcorn on his way back to the dressing room due to ankle sprain, which made Westbrook very angry. He wanted to rush to the stand to have a theory with the fan. Fortunately, he was under the basket of the staff and avoided the conflict. Afterwards, the Lakers star LeBron James tweeted for Westbrook.

"By the way, as players, we'd like to see who the asshole who smashed popcorn at Russell when he left because of his injury! There are cameras everywhere in the stadium, so there is no excuse# Protect our players, "James tweeted.

Speaking about it, Westbrook said: "to be honest, it's out of control. If it was me, I would not walk down the street to Westbrook and throw popcorn on his head, because you know what happens next... In the stadium, players have to be protected. Let's see how the NBA deals with it. "

"It's stupid. It shouldn't happen in the game," Davis bertans, a wizard, said after the game

Bradley bill is very dissatisfied with the action of the 76ers fans. "It's really disgusting. He may be the rat excrement. As a matter of fact, we have a lot of annoying fans. Tonight, some fans sprayed some crazy words on me, and my children even sat beside me Said bill.

Wizards coach Brooks is also very dissatisfied with this, called on the League to make such disrespectful behavior of people to investigate and ban punishment¡° Very rude. Hopefully this person will be banned from watching any game in the League because it's not acceptable. They won't do that on the street. " Brooks said.
