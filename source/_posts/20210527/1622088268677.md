On May 27, it is clear that famous basketball commentator Charles Barkley is not a fan of Miami Heat. Previously, Barker insisted the Milwaukee Bucks will sweep the heat in the first round of the series. And Buckley's attack on the heat is not over. He even thinks the heat's success last season is just a fluke.

"The heat's achievement in the finals last year may not receive much praise because it all happened in the bubble area of Orlando. Maybe the boys from Miami can only play in the bubble zone Barkley told Miami Herald reporter Barry Jackson.

However, the criticism did not stop there. Barkley called the heat "social dancers", which is related to the success of the heat in the Disney Park atmosphere last year.

Shaquille O'Neal, who once led the heat to win the championship, also shared his views on the current predicament of the old owners. "If I were in the same team as Jimmy Butler, I would ask him to participate and tell him 'I need you to be more selfish'. He is too unselfish, but I need my leader to shoot more than 10 times, especially when the team is behind by a big score. BAM Adebayor also has to come forward. I know you are a disciplined team, but sometimes in order to win, you have to be super selfish O'Neill said.
