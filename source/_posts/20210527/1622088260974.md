On May 27, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely, in which the New York Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks 101-92 to draw the total score to 1-1¡° "The fastest improving player" Randall got 15 points and 12 rebounds, but he only made 5 of 16 shots. He had 28 irons in two series, and 11 points in the third quarter of the game was his only mask.

Before the second game of the series, Knicks forward Julius Randall received the fastest growing player of the season trophy. It is worth mentioning that his son was awarded the prize.

It is the so-called "happy spirit", but Randall is obviously "too much". Over excited Randall missed three shots in the first 12 minutes of the first quarter and suffered "zero seal" in a single quarter. He was also the lowest efficiency in the first quarter of the Knicks.

After a mistake, Randall looked at the referee with a look of uncertainty. After all, his contribution to the first quarter was too suck. The only data he could get was 6 rebounds.

Until 4:13 in the second quarter, the new division's fastest progressive player finally made a foul, relying on the free throw to end the personal scoring shortage, but his sports shooting is to continue to play iron.

In the first game, Randall contributed 15 points and 12 rebounds, but he shot only 6 of 23 shots, with a shooting rate of 26.1%. In the first two quarters of the game, Randall lost 6 shots, with a positive and negative value of - 17.

After half-time, Randall finally ended the scoring shortage in the third quarter, and his three-point hit led to a wave of offensive climax of the Knicks.

Unfortunately, Randall's three-point shot, once again quickly disappeared. In an offensive single, he was obviously lack of confidence. After many dribbles and no chance to shoot, he jumped up and passed the ball to the off-site bench. This low-level mistake also forced the coach to ask for a pause.

After the pause, Randall improved significantly. He scored another three points, made a foul free throw, and made a breakthrough layup. The fastest progressive player scored 11 points in a single quarter, and delivered two pairs of 13 points and 10 rebounds at the end of the third quarter.

At the end of the game, Randall only scored two points, but his layup with 73 seconds left almost helped the Knicks win. However, it is an indisputable fact that the fastest progressive player has 28 shots in two games.
