In the aspect of wizards, although there are occasional highlights in the offensive end, the total 12 mistakes made by Wei Shao and bill have a huge impact on the game situation, and the defensive end can not limit the opponent's attack at all. Controlling mistakes and targeted defense are the important problems that need to be solved.

As soon as the game came up, Simmons scored the first record under the basket, and the eight village base was not outdone to score. In the first five minutes of the first quarter, the attacking efficiency of both sides was very high, and the game also fell into a stalemate. However, as weishao's Last Wizard entered the rotation, their attack efficiency plummeted, and there was no integrity at the offensive end. They could only score through bill's continuous single play. Although bill was in a very hot state, he was still hard to beat four hands in the face of the 76 with stronger comprehensive strength. In the second half of the first quarter, the 76ers played well in attack, with high integrity and high level of defense. With a wave of 22-10, the score of the first quarter was fixed at 35-24.

In the second quarter, Bill led the wizards to pursue the points, scored 2 + 1 under the eight village base, and bill also snatched to complete the counterattack. The Wizards started with a wave of 11-4 to close the score. However, the adjustment of the 76ers was also very rapid. First, Harris made a good shot in the middle, then enbid hit three points, and then Harris connected with Simmons to make a smash, and a wave of 7-0 re opened the score. But then Lopez continued to hook into the basket, bill also hit three points, but also a wave of 11-2 to catch up with the difference to only 2 points. But at the critical moment, the absolute gap between the two teams' strength will be directly reflected. Seeing that the leading edge is about to be exhausted, the 76ers immediately improved their defensive strength and the aggressiveness of the offensive end is also stronger. They played a wave of 12-4 in the last three minutes of the second quarter to reestablish a double-digit leading edge, with a 71-57 lead in the half.

When Yi Bian fights again, bill comes up with a jump shot in human life, and Seth here is not willing to be outdone and responds with a single jump shot. In the third section, both sides obviously improved their defensive strength, and the scoring efficiency also had a significant decline. Although the 76ers once opened the gap to 20 points, the wizard also relied on the tenacious willpower to widen the gap. With bill making a foul in the inside, the wizards were 80-94 behind in the third quarter.

At the end of the game, the wizard's attack was suddenly cut off completely. In the first two minutes, he only relied on technical fouls to get 1 point. The 76ers, Maxi became a surprise on the bench, a person even cut 9 points to help the 76ers once again will open the difference to 20 points. Seeing that the game is over, the wizards are not sending their own main team, and the game has lost suspense ahead of time. In the end, the 76ers beat the Wizards 120-95 to win the second game of the series.
