On June 24, according to previous reports, the Dallas Lone Ranger is looking for a new basketball director after breaking up with little Donnie Nelson. According to Marc Stein, a source familiar with the lone ranger's intentions revealed that the lone ranger does not want to hire such top executives as Masai ujeri of Toronto Raptors or Denny Angie, former Boston Celtic basketball operations president, to replace Nelson Jr.

According to sources, the lone Rangers don't want to hire big executives, mainly because such executives will ask for more autonomy, while team owner Mark Cuban doesn't want to give too much autonomy. Marc Stein previously reported that the lone rangers are strongly considering hiring Michael Finley, one of Dirk Nowitzki's favorite former teammates, as the team's head of basketball operations. But even if Finley gets the job, Dallas will hire a new member from outside. Kuban, the boss, needs to be as versatile and experienced as the lone Rangers can muster, because he will always be the leader of the team and prefers to make the final decision after consulting senior assistants.

"I'm a big fan of little NILs. He's not only a business partner, but also a friend. I don't want to see him leave. I mean, he's going to be one of the greatest general managers the lone ranger has ever had. Obviously, he did a lot of great things, bringing Dirk Nowitzki and Luca donchich here. He's definitely the top executive in basketball Jason Terry said, "you know, Mavericks star Mark Cuban is very competitive. He will make sure the right person is in the right position. He would like to see Michael Finley sitting in that position. Dirk is back now, so they will be great leaders. In addition, the team has a great star Luca, they will continue to build around him, we will also see them make great progress in the playoffs
