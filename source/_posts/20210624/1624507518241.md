On June 24, NBA officials announced that clippers center demarchus cousins was punished with an additional technical foul for deliberately pushing Devon Booker in the Western Conference finals G2.

In G3 on Wednesday, the Clippers had a one point lead at the end of the game. At that time, Jay Claude served the baseline ball, he threw the ball high into the basket, and de Andre Aton finished the empty dunk.

When Aton helped the Suns get the key 2 points and overtook the score, many people rushed into the field. Television pictures capture that cousins deliberately pushed Booker. Booker was ready to go forward to find the theory of cousins and was held by the staff.

After the referee looked back at the video, in addition to determining that Aton's free throw dunk was effective, the suns only used 0.2 seconds to cooperate with the baseline, that is, the last 0.7 seconds left in the game.

As the Clippers did not pause at that time, they could only serve at the bottom line and failed to perform a miracle. In the end, the Suns narrowly beat the Clippers at home, taking a 2-0 lead.

The 30-year-old is not in the Clippers' regular rotation. Since this year's playoffs, koshins has only played four games, averaging 8.0 minutes per game, with 6.3 points and 2.8 rebounds.
