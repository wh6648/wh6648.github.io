It is reported on June 24 that there are not many privileged players who can change the balance of the team in the free agent lineup in 2021, but by 2022, some superstars will become the target of many teams. One of them is Stephen curry of Golden State Warriors, who will enter the free agent market as a full free agent next year.

Curry's current contract with the warriors was signed in the summer of 2017. It is a five-year contract with a total value of $201 million. His salary will exceed $45 million in the 2021-22 season and will expire in the summer of 2022. According to the relevant rules, the warriors can renew their contract with curry ahead of schedule this summer. If curry enters the free agent market, it will have an impact on the entire league, especially on the Los Angeles Lakers.

According to previous reports, the Lakers superstar LeBron James has been trying to recruit Stephen curry for months, hoping to join the Lakers in 2022. Warriors boss Joe lecobu responded to this in an interview today, saying that curry would not leave the team.

"Look, Stephen curry, if he really wants to leave after the end of his contract, he's a free agent, he has the right to do it, he can do it, I said to Kevin Durant "I'm still a friend of Kevin Durant and I still like him very much," warriors boss Joe raikob said. I will always love what he does for this team. By the way, he took very little money when he was here. He really helped us a lot. We've also found a few other players, players don't usually do that, but he did, so I have great respect and admiration for Kevin Durant. Whatever Stephen (curry) does, I will support him. He has done a lot for us and, of course, we have done a lot for him. I hope we can provide him with an environment where he wants to spend the rest of his life. "

"Of course I'm not worried about the recruiter (James) you mentioned. I don't think that will happen." Warriors owner Joe raikob added.

Curry has been playing for the warriors since 2009, when the warriors picked him seventh. During the dynasty of the team, curry helped the team win the championship three times, and then the team was forced to withdraw from the competition due to constant injuries. It's not clear how curry plans his career at the moment, and team owner lecob says he has the right to leave in the free market if curry wants to. Whether curry is willing to cooperate with the Lakers is still unknown, because the Lakers need to sort out their financial situation before they can bring in players like curry.
