On June 24, the NBA playoffs continued. In the first game of the Eastern Conference finals, the Hawks beat the Bucks 116-113 away, leading 1-0. In addition to Trey Young's superb performance, Collins scored 23 points and 15 rebounds in 11-for-16 shots, which is also a great credit for the team's success. Schulter scored 13 points and performed quite well.

As an important receiving end point of the Hawks' outside line, schulter plays a more and more important role in the current Hawks' formation. In the last round of the competition with the 76ers, his hand has great ups and downs, but in the first game of the Eastern Conference finals, his state is quite good. Starting from the second quarter, he scored continuously. In the middle of the second quarter, he first picked up and rolled, then went to the free throw line to catch the ball, and then made a pitching jump shot. Then he received Trey Yang's back pass and scored three points. After Trey Yang's crazy scoring, schulter continued his firepower and helped the Bucks hit a wave of 15-5 climax to realize the anti super.

In the third quarter, although he missed two three points, he used two breakthrough throws to help the Hawks keep chasing points. In addition to Trey young, the most important one is Collins, who didn't have many chances in the first half, but broke out suddenly in the third quarter.

At the end of the third quarter, first he grabbed the front court rebounds under the basket to make up the basket, and then he finished a wonderful empty catch and slam dunk. In the counterattack, Terry Yang broke through to the basket and threw the ball to the backboard. Collins, who had a good understanding of the situation, followed up the catch from behind to finish the empty catch and slam dunk. Then he and Terry Yang finished the empty catch and slam dunk again, and then he made a dry pull shot, The difference was widened to eight

When he fell behind to 7 points, Collins flew to the crowd to make up the basket, and then went down to catch the ball and lay up to make a strong attack. Soon, he struggled to grab the front rebounds and made a critical three-point dash in the bottom corner to help the Bucks catch up to one point in the last minute. Although Trey young is the biggest hero of the Hawks' victory, Collins' continuous smashing in the third quarter is the biggest reason for the team to surpass the score. At the last moment of the last quarter, Collins' active fighting and attack under the basket laid a solid foundation for the reversal.
