On June 24, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. Milwaukee Bucks are at home for the first game of the Eastern Conference finals with the Atlanta Hawks. At the end of the game, the eagles narrowly beat the Bucks 116-113 to make a good start to the series.

Before the start of this series, a basic judgment is that the paper strength of the eagles and bucks is at a disadvantage.

After all, in the Hawks' lineup, Trey young, John Collins, schulter and other young masters have never played in the playoffs before this season, and they are also the first time to stand on such a high-end stage as the East duel.

In addition, as a team of strong attack and weak defense, whether the Hawks can withstand the strong impact of letter brother is also worth watching.

The Bucks side, just experienced the semi-finals and nets after the baptism of fierce competition, morale and self-confidence is undoubtedly at a high point.

But when the game really starts, it's not what people expect. Although, from the scene, the Hawks are relatively passive most of the time, but the difference has not been opened, blowing Yang with his superstar level play, has been carrying the team forward, and always put pressure on the Bucks defense.

As a very flexible player, Trey young is very difficult to defend. Looking at the entire bucks lineup, the only one who can really play against Yang is Huo ledi. However, in this game, the Bucks' use of huoledi is somewhat contradictory. After all, the team still needs the latter's offensive firepower. When playing in a small team, they also expect him to change his defense to the inside line. Therefore, in order not to overuse holiday brother, he has not been arranged to play single defense all the time.

However, when the other bucks players are in opposition with Yang, the disadvantage is naturally reflected. Whether it's Connaughton, tiger or Forbes, they will be easily thrown away in front of Yang's light pace.

It was the Bucks' hesitation in defense that raised Yang's hand. With the progress of the game, he became more and more crazy. In the third quarter, he made an unconventional smash to assist Collins to slam the button, which shocked the Bucks' home audience. One time in front of three meters no one's three-point shot, blowing Yang is the first to do a provocative action, and then the ball into, obviously self-confidence has burst.

When the game came to the end, when blowing Yang scored 40 +, 10 + assists, the balance of victory gradually fell to the Hawks side. When the eagles will be more than the score, when the Bucks were suddenly forced into a desperate situation, against the wind situation, the Bucks suddenly become helpless.

Although it must be admitted that after the defeat, Bucks paper advantage still exists, they still have the ability to beat the opponent. But in the next competition, facing this young opponent, the Bucks have to play more finely. In terms of tactical layout, especially the limitation of blowing Yang, they need to be more clear.
