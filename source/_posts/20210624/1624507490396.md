June 24 news, from "Yahoo Sports" reporter Chris - Hannes reported that informed sources revealed that unless there is an unexpected setback, the Suns star Chris - Paul plans to play in the Western Conference finals G3.

On Wednesday morning local time, Paul successfully passed a cardiorespiratory aerobic test, which was the last step in ending the health and safety agreement, the source said. In other words, CP3 has been allowed to return to the league.

According to previous rumors, Paul had been vaccinated with the new crown vaccine, but he was still positive in the new crown test last week.

The Suns swept the Nuggets 4-0 in the Western Conference semifinals. After that, Paul arrived in Los Angeles and was told that he was infected with the new crown. Therefore, according to the League health and safety agreement, Paul was quarantined in Los Angeles.

According to sources, Paul went to Los Angeles because he wanted to surprise his wife and children.

According to the information obtained by Hannes, Paul has been asymptomatic infected, but the cause of his infection is still a mystery.

Paul is the core and offensive organizer of the suns. He averaged 31.2 minutes in the playoffs this year, with 15.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, 8.7 assists and 1.2 steals.

This year's playoffs are full of twists and turns for Paul. In addition to the new crown infection, he also suffered a shoulder injury in the first round of the playoffs.
