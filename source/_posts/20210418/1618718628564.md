Before the Celtic away game, the warriors have won four games in a row. Quietly, they have risen to the ninth place in the west, only one game away from the eighth Grizzlies.

The driving force for the warriors to improve their state, of course, comes from curry. In recent years, curry has scored 30 + points in nine games. His shooting firepower and his sense of three-way break-up seem to have returned to the top 73 winning season of 15-16. For this crazy state, almost all teams in the League should pay attention to it.

So, come to today's game, Celtic came up on the tight defense of curry, in the first section of the three-point shot, the next half of the ball time, curry's state is not particularly excellent.

The green army has achieved some results in the garrison defense of KULI, but the problem is that now, around KULI, other people's hands are gradually stimulated. When the green shirt team surrounded curry, Wiggins, bezmore and other role players also looked for a lot of scoring opportunities.

Finally, this kind of attack appeared loose after half a quarter, and the outbreak of KULI, also need this opportunity. Curry broke away from the tight defense and hit three points, layups and free throws in a row. Before the green army's defense recovered, he had 14 points, and the warriors quickly established their advantage.

The second quarter, the warriors substitute's projection feel continues, most of the time, they led by 15 points. When curry came back, the attack of the warriors became more and more difficult to stop. During this period, Meng Shen's routine shot was able to score. After shaking the outside line once, he also scored three points with his magic left hand behind his head. Although the ball was blown on the line, it was enough to shock everyone.

But after that, the situation was not as easy as curry expected. Mengshen's knees were bleeding, and the green army gradually caught up with the score after a crazy attack. In the stalemate, curry's three points are still hitting. He scored 30 points in his 10th game in a row and tied Kobe's record, ranking first among players 33 years old or older.

But Curry's milestone didn't make his teammates relaxed. After three quarters, the two sides drew 89. Entering the last section of the fierce battle, both teams will raise their fighting spirit to a new level.

Unfortunately, curry sprained his ankle and fell to the ground in pain when he received the ball. However, he quickly stood up, took painkillers and hit the three-point ball hobbled by the pain. Next to curry, Toscano Anderson flew out of bounds in a save, fell on the technical stage and had to be replaced.
