On June 3, Phoenix Suns General Manager James Jones talked about team star Chris Paul in an interview today. Jones said Paul's shoulder injury is OK and he is "ready" to play the sixth game of the series against the Lakers.

"Paul's fine. He'll be ready to play. I think he has shown in his career, especially in the near future - if he can play to help the team, he will Jones said, "we'll be fine. We're ready for a tough fight."

When asked about Paul, Jones said: "unless he doesn't play, we plan that he will play."

Paul was injured in the G5 game of the series with the Lakers. There were 6 minutes and 47 seconds left in the third quarter. While fighting for rebounds under the basket, the Laker's Matthews hit Paul's injured shoulder in the process of blocking. After a brief treatment, Paul returned to the field, completed two free throws, and then was replaced and missed the rest of the game.

After the game, Suns coach Monty Williams said Paul didn't seem to be doing anything. When Paul returned to the bench, he told coach Williams that his shoulder still had strength. Team mate Devon Booker said that Paul's injured shoulder was injured again, which is very unfortunate, but he knows that Matthews' defense does not have dirty action. At the same time, Booker also said that Paul can complete two free throws, which shows that his shoulder still has strength.

Paul admitted that the aggravation of the shoulder injury "scared" him, and that feeling made him "uncomfortable". But Paul said he would get better and he talked a lot with Kyle lorry, who had a similar injury.
