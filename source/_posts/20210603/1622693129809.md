On June 3, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely. The Washington Wizards lost 112-129 to the Philadelphia 76ers and were eliminated 4-1. In the battle of life and death, the wizard's "double core" Wei Shao and bill jointly scored 56 points, but Wei Shao only had three assists in the second half, and too much competition with opponents and referees also led to the failure of the wizard team.

Since the fourth game of the series pulled back one city, the division of labor between "double core" bill and Wei Shao has become more clear. Weishao pass, bill is responsible for the ball into the basket, maybe this rhythm is simple and rough, but for the wizard, it may be the most efficient.

In the first two quarters, Bill played 20 minutes. He made 6 of 11 shots, 2 of 1 three-point, 8 of 8 free throws, and scored 21 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists.

In this round of series, Bill's highest number of free throws in a single game is 8 times, and this game only tied the record in two quarters, which shows Bill's determination to kill the inside. After all, the 76ers team's ability to protect the basket in the interior line is obviously reduced due to the injury of "emperor" enbide. Therefore, Bill's attack on the interior line is also the safest way to score.

Compared with Bill's efficient scoring, Willis also worked hard. He only rested 3 minutes and 46 seconds in the two quarters. His playing time is the highest in the team, and his attitude towards the game is absolutely "diligent". Apart from being serious, the data were awesome. He handed in 14 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists in the half court, but the old problems of "easy to go up" were never avoided.

When he received the ball in the backcourt, green followed him all the time. While Wei Shao didn't pay attention, green successfully grabbed the ball and then made a layup easily. Wei Shao was obviously annoyed by this low-level mistake, and he began to compete with green.

With the last low-level error, since then the 76ers used Green's close press to strengthen the back court of weishao when catching the ball. With 3.1 seconds left from the end of the half-time, in order to successfully receive the ball, Wesson pushed green in the escape for a foul.

Although Wei's half court 14 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists were awesome, he lost a foul because of two low turnovers, which led to 4 turnovers in half, and 6 in the team.

In the third quarter, the number of weishao's fouls increased sharply, two of which were unnecessary retaliatory fouls, especially the layup after the breakthrough. After weishao complained to the referee that it had no effect, he immediately fouled Simmons. It's because major general Williams put too much energy into competing with referees and opponents that his efficiency dropped rapidly. At the same time, the wizards were led by the 76ers by 11 points.

In the last quarter, Wei Shao didn't calm down all the time, while the 76ers played more and more relaxed, the leading edge expanded to more than 20 points, and the 56 points of the "double core" of the Wizards also lost their meaning.
