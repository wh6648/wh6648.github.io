On June 2, the Celtics officially announced that Denny Angie had officially resigned and Brad Stevens was appointed as the new president of basketball operations of the green army. At the same time, Angie will continue to work with the green army in the coming off-season to make future plans, and the green army's search for a new manager will start immediately.

"Helping this team is the most exciting thing in my life," Angie, 62, said in a statement. I've been fighting with Stevens since he came to Boston, so there's nothing better than Stevens leading this team. I want to thank the team owner, all my colleagues, and the best fans in the basketball world for joining me in this journey

According to the tip from the famous NBA reporter Samas chalaniya, Stevens has been tired of being the team manager since last season in the playoff zone, and he welcomes the opportunity to enter the management. It's worth mentioning that Angie is also from the coach to the team management, which happened in the Phoenix period.

Angie came to Boston in 2003. His greatest achievement in the green army is to form the three giants of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, and win the NBA championship in 2008. In the 18 years of the green army, Angie has only hired two managers in all - signed Doug rivers in 2004. Stevens began coaching the green army after going to the Clippers in rivers in 2013.

In his eight seasons as manager of the green army, Stevens's coaching record is 354-282, with a victory rate of 55.7%. He led the team to the playoffs seven times, including three Eastern Conference finals in 2017, 2018 and 2020.

According to relevant statistics, Stevens led the green army to win 38 playoffs, second only to Steve Cole (77 wins) and Tyrone Lu (43 wins) in the same period.
