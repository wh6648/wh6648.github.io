The Washington Wizards made it to the playoffs, but were ruthlessly eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers, the top of the Eastern Conference. But don't forget that the Wizards have not entered the playoffs for two consecutive years due to the injury of wall and the departure of Otto porter. It's not easy for Williams to pull the team back to the series. This season, Wei Shao has 22.2 points, 11.5 rebounds and 11.7 assists, winning three doubles again. The three pairs can be said to be valuable to Wei Shao, but these three pairs are not the other three pairs. Wei Shao this season has been reborn from the Phoenix Nirvana.

Three doubles, that is, in the basketball game scoring, rebounding, assists, steals and blocks, three technical statistics reach double digits. In ancient times, the strongest triple double was Oscar Robertson, who scored 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, 11.4 assists and won triple doubles in 41 games in 1962. After big O, triple double data is very rare. Kidd, Kirilenko or James can get a triple double on the news. In the 2017 season, weishao was born in the sky, scoring three doubles and breaking the big O record with 42 triple doubles. Weishao has won three doubles in four seasons so far. Weishao also set off a triple double fever, with harden, James and Jokic all winning a lot of triple doubles.

Behind the gorgeous data, weishao was questioned. When he and Durant formed Wang Fang's group, people criticized him for "defending Durant"; After Durant left, in the 2017 season, weishaoli beat harden to win the MVP. People said that he relied on one person, one city to tell stories and earned sympathy points in exchange for the consolation award with Durant's curse. Wei Shao led the team independently for four years, and only stopped for two rounds when the Rockets acted as the second leader of harden. Thunder is expected to beat Jazz (18 seasons) and Trail Blazers (19 seasons), but it is still taken lightly by the opponents, which pushes weishao to the top of the storm.

Admittedly, it's unfair to give the team's failure to Wei Shao. Anthony, George and Schroeder lost their links in the playoffs, and Donovan's poor on-the-spot command should be held responsible. However, Wei Shao is really responsible. As a playmaker, he can break through and tear up the opponent's space and create opportunities for his teammates. He has strong ability of passing and assists, but his field control ability is not so good that he can not connect with the whole team to organize attacks. The team often falls into a single fight (Paul takes over the thunder in 2020 season and takes on a new look, which is a bitter irony of Wei Shao). It seems that Wei Shao is suspected of brushing data. It is said that he will study technical statistics at half-time. There are rumors that "Wei Shao with nine boards is the most active, Wei Shao with nine assists is the most selfless, and Wei Shao with nine points is like Jordan".

While Wei Shao is stigmatized by the Internet, people ignore the other side of Wei Shao: Wei Shao is devoted to his family, never flirts with others, and Nina is a model couple in the league. Wei Shao is friendly and affectionate. After his defeat in 2016 season, he asked Durant, "what can I change for you?" Unfortunately, it can't save Durant's heart. He may have been paranoid about brushing data, but he is willing to make changes for the team. In the 2020 season, he will no longer brush triple doubles, but help harden share the ball power, increase the proportion of air cutting, and improve the team's attack.

This season, he transferred to the Washington Wizards. Under the coach of brooks, the team's main players are attacking in singles. The division of labor between the two stars is clear: Wei Shao's sudden points connect the team, and Bill's single points cut; The team's space is very poor, the three-point shooting rate is only 35.1%, the 22nd in the league, making the offensive efficiency only 110.7, the 17th in the league. Due to the lack of resources, the efficiency of the defensive end is only 112.3, ranking 20th in the league. It can be said that if the wizards can't play, the team will be in danger.

When Wei Shao first joined the wizard, he was also determined to brush the data. In December, he had three doubles in the first four games, but all of them lost, helping his opponent "Kill Bill". Eager to win, Wei Shao adjusted his playing style in January, no longer obsessed with triple doubles, increased his offensive firepower, averaged 21.6 points per game, and reduced his assists to 7.9, still only achieving a record of 5 losses in 7 games (two wins in the nets).

He finally found the balance between individual attack and team attack in February, which can not only drive the whole team, but also provide offensive firepower. All this is inseparable from his efforts. As his jump shot plummeted from 2019 (possibly due to a decline in fitness), his hit rate dropped to 31.4% (compared with 36% in 2018). This season, he tried hard to find the touch of jump shot, the regular season jump shot hit rate reached 37.2%, three-point hit rate was only 31.5%; His jump shot comfort zone is within the three-point line, and the total jump shot hit rate is 40.3%, which is good. Although his layup percentage is only 53%, he has a good attack strength. That's why he's stable enough to score. He's also restored to his level of attacking the basket and tearing up the defense. He's also spared no effort to connect the team's attacks, averaging 11.7 assists per game, driving bill, bamun and bertans to score. In a word, his three pairs are natural, not brush. He also became the leader of the players, inspired his teammates, and became the bosom brother of the young players. He once encouraged bamura to say: "you can defend from the first position to the fifth position." Bachun was inspired and more active in defense. He led the team to win eight games in a row at the end of the season. After that, he pushed the Hornets to the top eight and beat the Pacers in the playoff to advance to the eighth place in the East.

But our weishao is old after all. Without the speed, explosive power and projectile speed of our youth, we are no longer the Megatron of the past. He is no longer the iron man he used to be when he was young. His legs and feet are often injured. He is not good at using pick and roll to score, and tends to rely on his body; When he was young, straight-line breakthrough was rampant (better to protect his body than Ross, a star who relies on changing direction and pulling rod), but the lack of skills led to the general ability of ending. Now both breakthrough and ending have fallen; As the three-point shooting rate is still very low, the half cut basket in the restricted area is not enough to open the opponent's defense; His jump shot hit rate is OK, but not very stable, the opponent used to put the way to deal with him; Because the end is poor, the opponent forces him from the outside into the inside, and then guards the basket from the inside to contain him. Last season, the Laker's regional defense blockade froze him and the Rockets. This season's opponents are still like this. Wei Shao averaged 4.2 three-point shots per game, 2.4 empty shots and 1.6 semi empty shots.

The first round opponent of the wizards, the Philadelphia 76ers, has gone through a big change this season, replacing coach brown, who is infatuated with the twin towers, and introducing rivers; Send off hofford and Richardson, and welcome Daniel Green, little curry and Howard. According to the data management mode, the team changed the double tower playing method to one big four small, to create a modern space basketball. Simmons reduced the proportion of attack, put more energy on the organization, push fast attack and defense; Enbid strengthened the attack, played the MVP level, Harris, green, hill and small curry projection first-class, support the team offensive space. And the wizard defense is very poor, only a few people such as garford and eight villages can defend, the overall miserable. Wei Shao was able to defend his opponent's sharp knife when he was young, but now he can't defend either. The team faced 76 people inside and outside. In the face of lane and garford's inside, enbid can be described as cutting melons and cutting vegetables to get whatever he wants. Simmons leads the whole team and easily leads to free space projection. The 76ers shot a 38% three-point percentage.

The 76ers have the league's second-largest defensive iron barrel formation, with Denny green, Simmons and Sebel defending the outside line, and enbid and Howard guarding the inside line. They hit the wizard's engine, Wei Shao, with their free throws, and cut off Wei Shao's pass line, freezing the wizard's outside line. The aging Wei Shao can only rely on carrying the explosive bag to cut points, averaging 19 points and 11.8 assists, but the efficiency is low, with a three-point shooting rate of 25%. Other players are also limited. Top star Bill's three-point shooting rate of 22% (which is also related to his fatigue injury), Ismail Smith and netto's three-point shooting rate of less than 30%, and the team's three-point shooting rate of 29% are too low to be seen. When the 76ers snuffed out the wizards, the game lost suspense.
