On June 3, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely. The Philadelphia 76ers beat the Washington Wizards 129-112 to advance 4-1. Simmons changed to play center when "emperor" nbid was absent due to injury. He got 19 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in three doubles, and made 8 free throws and 5 free throws, obviously coming out of the "free throw black hole".

In the fifth game of the first round of the playoffs, "emperor" was absent due to injury.

In view of the lack of enbid, the 76ers made bold changes. Coach rivers will put sebur on the starting line-up, and the team's starting point guard Ben Simmons will be the starting center, he will be paired with the wizard's gaford.

In history, the most successful example of a point guard playing as a center is the replacement of the injured "Tiangou" Jabbar by "magic" Johnson in the finals. At that time, the "magic" successfully led the team to defeat the opponent and win the championship.

After the opening, Simmons hit the first goal of the 76ers in the singles. Since then, 76 people counterattack, Simmons fast break after receiving the team mate's high throw slam to score. In the first quarter, Simmons' performance was very good. He made 2 of 4 shots in 8 minutes, contributed 4 points, 2 assists and 1 rebound, and made no mistakes.

In fact, goals and assists in sports, even playing center, are not Simmons's biggest headache. On the contrary, free throws have become a barrier Simmons can not get past. So far in this round of series, Ben Simmons has made 5 of 20 free throws on the free throw line, and made 0 of 9 free throws in the first three games.

It is for the penalty short board, the Wizards in the second quarter opened the "cut Simmons tactics.". However, judging from the 3 hits of the first 4 free throws, Simon's hand was awesome today. This also led to the temporary abandonment of Simmons tactics by the Wizards.

After half-time, Simmons continued the good feeling of free throw in the first half. He hit two free throws in three times and kept his personal free throw percentage above 60%. This is the highest free throw percentage in this round of series.

Free throw steady, Simmons offensive end is more comfortable. In the third quarter, Simmons not only got 6 points, but also sent 5 assists. It was under his leadership that the 76ers gradually expanded the lead, once leading by 11 points. Simmons handed over 15 points and 9 assists in the third quarter.

In the last quarter, Simmons took full control of the situation on the court. He slammed the basket at the offensive end, grabbed the rebounds in the back court and assisted his teammates. With a rebound in the last three minutes, Simmons completed his own triple doubles, which is also his third triple doubles in the playoffs.
