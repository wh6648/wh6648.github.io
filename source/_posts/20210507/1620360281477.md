On May 7, according to previous reports, Boston Celtic power forward Tristan Thompson was once again exposed to be unfaithful to Kohler Thompson. Sydney chase, a popular online model, claims that Thompson and coller Kardashian have been in a romantic relationship since they got back together, and she has received several pornographic text messages from Thompson.

Thompson strongly denied all of Sydney Chase's comments and sought his legal team to resolve Sydney Chase's charges. According to reports, the Thompson camp has filed a termination letter against Sydney chase. Today, Sydney chase confirmed that she had received the termination letter.

"I posted on the Internet and finally received the termination letter a few hours ago. It was sent to an email that I no longer use. I won't be called a liar. " Sydney chase wrote.

Asked if there was any evidence of an affair with Tristan Thompson, Sydney chase said: "yes, of course I do. But it's a legal issue and needs to be dealt with by lawyers. Thank you. "

It is worth mentioning that the Thompson camp asked Sydney chase to produce all the evidence of text messages between the two: "we are sure that any text messages you claim to have will not withstand this kind of censorship. The truth will be revealed. All your stories about my client are made up. Of course, we suspect that you will allow us to review any so-called information, because our review of these texts will confirm that they are forged. "

In addition, Thompson's lawyer sent a termination letter to no jumper host Adam 22, which has deleted the so-called "indulgence" part of Sydney Chase's interview.
