May 7, 2020-21 season NBA regular season continues, Brooklyn nets away challenge Dallas lone ranger. At the end of the game, the net lost 109-113 to the lone ranger, swallowing four consecutive losses.

This battle, Dong Qiqi in the opponent's defense, 22 shots only 7, but he still got 24 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists, led the team to win.

In the last 10 games, the lone ranger has won 7 and lost 3, showing an obvious upward trend. As the core, Luca dongqiqi's play is undoubtedly decisive.

This battle, the home game against one of the league's strongest offensive team nets, Dong Qiqi's ability to lead the team has met a new test.

For Dong Qiqi's defense, there are two general ways. One is to limit his personal attack and freeze him with a bag; The other is the main defense of his pass, forcing him to attack personally.

Obviously, this night, the nets chose the second way.

The reason why the nets do this is that they trust Owen and Durant, the two core players in the team. Nash's basic judgment is that his team is not afraid to attack with lone ranger and Dong Qiqi.

The rebounding strategy is quite successful. In the first quarter, Dong Qiqi scored with a free throw, and the backward three points were also easily scored. But in passing, because of the opponent's aim, he made low-level mistakes.

After that, Dong Qiqi threw another three-point backward step, but frankly, he didn't feel good. But the teammates, in the case of cutting off the pass contact with Dong Qiqi, can still use their personal ability to score, which relieved a lot of pressure on Dong Qiqi's shoulder.

However, as one of the most outstanding offensive talent players in active service, Dong Qiqi is unlikely to be depressed in the whole game. In the middle of the second quarter, he seized the slack of the defense of the nets, and suddenly broke out. In less than a minute, he made three consecutive three-point shots, and even hit all the shots.

In the second reading stage of this section, with Dong Qiqi making a foul free throw into the net, he scored 19 points in the half time and scored five three-point goals. In the attack with Durant and Owen, he did not fall behind at all.

Dong Qiqi's strength in the second quarter inevitably changed the defense of the net against him. Therefore, after changing the edge, the defensive strength of the net against him became higher and higher, and began to restrict him with the clip in time.

In this case, Dong Qiqi's hit rate naturally decreased, and his mistakes in passing also began to increase. Similar to many nights, after he was intercepted, he began to talk around the referee again.

At the end of the game, Dong Qiqi was more fiercely defended and it was very difficult to score. However, after attracting defense, he was able to assist his teammates to score.

In addition, Dong Qiqi is also accumulating strength, entering the last quarter of the second reading stage, he finally decided to kill the game, only to see his steady dribble, against Durant's single defense, you know, before, he had several single KD without success, but at the most critical moment, he used the team's legendary Nowitzki's unique skill, facing KD to complete the Golden Rooster independent jump shot.
