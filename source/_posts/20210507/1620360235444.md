On May 7, the nets lost 109-113 to the lone Rangers. Carey Owen made 17 of 31 shots and 7 of 13 three-point shots, contributing 45 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals and 2 blocks.

As we all know, Carey Owen is a very headstrong guy who announced before the start of the season that he would not be interviewed by the media. Owen once again refused to be interviewed by the media after his 118-124 defeat to the Bucks, and the League again handed him a $35000 ticket. Although Owen has done a lot of "ridiculous" things off the court, as long as he steps on the field, Owen is still conscientious and will do his best to help the team win. Owen also said in an interview that he was willing to share some things for Durant. Durant carried too much along the way.

Today, in the face of the lone ranger, Owen launched his personal attack mode early, scoring an accurate three-point ball in the outside line. A few rounds later, Owen again put the ball into the net, with this ball, the net will be reduced to 1 point difference. When the lone ranger opened the gap, Owen immediately stepped out, threw off two defenders with the ball and quickly went to the basket to complete the attack.

With 8 minutes and 17 seconds left in the second quarter, Owen made his debut. After coming up, it began to break out. First, it scored three points in the storm, followed by five points in a row, including 2 + 1 on Hadaway. Relying on Owen's excellent performance, the net rebounded the score to 49-47. Owen was deeply stimulated by Dong Qiqi's continuous three-point shooting. The latter once again showed his various offensive means. After three points were sent into the net, Owen was ready to attack with the ball in 39.4 seconds. The lone ranger's two defenders immediately killed him to make a trap, but they obviously couldn't keep up with Owen's pace. Owen easily passed the defenders and came to the basket to throw. Owen made 10 of 14 shots and 4 of 6 three-point shots at half-time, contributing 25 points.

Another long-distance fight, Durant back foul trouble, all the heavy responsibility falls on Owen. Facing Owen in the single nuclear battle, the lone ranger's defensive strategy is very clear. Owen is not afraid of any defense, the ball is also very stable with the basket. In 6:52, Owen and Griffin played a wonderful match. Owen attracted the two men to defend and then passed the ball to Griffin, who jumped high after catching the ball and made a wonderful smash with his left hand. Under Owen's instigation, the nets entered the last quarter with a 1-point advantage.

When Durant couldn't find his hand, Owen came out again. In 5:44, Owen hit the jump shot of three defenders, and then Owen scored three points in the outside line, relying on his personal super ability to help the nets grasp the score. One minute and 15 seconds, Owen beat Brunson and got the chance of free throw. Although Owen later also in the outside line wind in three points, but unfortunately, Owen's high efficiency production failed to help the nets in exchange for a victory.
