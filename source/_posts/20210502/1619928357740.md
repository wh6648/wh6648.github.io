The sudden outbreak of little Porter makes the reconstruction and collapse of the Rockets look full of hope. In fact, the Rockets have given up this season, and many people are in the future assessment, such as wood and ollinick. On May 2, 2021, the Rockets lost 87-113 to the warriors, wood scored 10 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists, and little Potter scored 16 points and 6 assists.

After the opening, little Porter hit his first three-point goal. It seems that little Porter, who made history in the last game, is still in the afterlife, and continues to this game directly. The shooting ability of wood and orinik made the Rockets surpass the warriors in the first quarter. They are more mobile and not afraid of Green's height and impact. This pair of interior combination seems to be good at attack and defense.

At the beginning of the second quarter, the Rockets played a quick conversion attack. Jeffries, who came here from King, once became a sharp weapon. He hit a three-point shot. Then the Rockets made a wonderful counterattack after fighting back on the spot. Orinik pushed the ball forward and waited for the opportunity to move. Jeffries, who threw the ball high and inserted the assist, finished the empty catch. Ollinick, in his contract year, still played a very good performance. In the second quarter, he became the hub of attack and defense, lured opponents to foul by three points, and even pushed forward the fast break layup by himself after stealing in the back court.

In addition, little Porter, Tate and Martin are now the attack trio of the Rockets. They are all capable of impact, running and jumping. In particular, Martin's several attacks in the second quarter are impressive. Whether it's the continuous take-off of the second layup, or the violent bottom line attack, they are very violent. And little Porter also ushered in a small burst in the second quarter, the second quarter in a row to lead the team to play climax. At half-time, little Porter was still the first in the team with 14 points.

But at the beginning of the second half, the Rockets suddenly went silent, and wood was teased by curry in a row. The team's three most powerful attack lines showed their shortcomings of inexperience and unstable shooting. The Rockets even didn't score for as long as five minutes and were attacked. In the third quarter, if it wasn't for the sporadic attacks of wood and Porter, it would be difficult to score in the third quarter. In this game, the Rockets showed the shortcomings of no arrow figure at the critical moment. The fourth quarter became rubbish and the time was finally reversed by the warriors.
