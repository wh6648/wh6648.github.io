As far as curry is concerned, he not only has to work hard to make the warriors return to the top eight in the later games, but also his scoring battle with bill has entered the white hot stage. On May 2, 2021, the warriors defeated the Rockets 113-87, scoring 30 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists in front of their old opponent, rockets curry. In the third quarter of the half-time, when the feeling was not good, the warriors had a big burst, shooting 23 points and hitting 5 three points.

Although the opponent is no longer the opponent of the past, the warriors are always full of topic and fatalism when they play the Rockets. Curry hit two three-point shots in a row at the beginning, and his hand is still hot. Of course, curry now seems to be superstitious about his outside line. The first four shots are from outside. So far this season, curry's average of 12.1 three-point shots per game has been a career high, surpassing the 73 win season and the 18 year championship season. His average of 5.2 is also a career high.

After the start of the game, he made five three-point shots six times, one of which was directly challenged by Cole in the first quarter, but the final challenge failed. Curry was on the outside in the first quarter, hoping to play rhythm and feel. However, too many three-point shots still affected Curry's shooting, and even one shot simply shot three non stick shots, and there were three mistakes in the first quarter. In the second quarter, this state still did not change, but intensified. Curry was too obsessed with outside shots, which seriously slowed down the rhythm of the warriors. 10 three-point shots for 12 shots at half time, 0 point in a single quarter or even only 2 assists were the fundamental reasons for the warriors to fall behind.

Fortunately, after the beginning of the third quarter, curry finally began to reduce the attack frequency of the outside line, he began to increase the ball free attack and counter run, and sent two consecutive assists to lead the team to play a small climax, and finally approached the Rockets. When curry reduced the outside attack, the Warriors also increased the conversion rate. In the seventh minute of the third quarter, curry finally made another three-point shot in the bottom corner and overtook the Rockets. After that, curry even roared.

After the ball, curry made another three-point foul close to the logo, and made another three-point shot in the bottom corner of the right side through the pick and roll. At this time, the warrior, who was once 10 points behind, had surpassed 11 points. In the fifth minute of the third quarter, curry, who had already killed the red eye, singled out wood and finished a difficult three-point game. After a round, he dribbled and tricked wood to make fouls. In a few minutes, curry led the team to make a crazy 24-0 counterattack.

The whole third quarter became Curry's performance time. Whether it was empty three-point or dribble single three-point, curry reversed the game in the third quarter. In the second minute of the third quarter, curry scored three points after half-time. Curry scored 23 points in a single quarter and made five three-point shots. In the fourth quarter, curry simply didn't show up and clocked out. In the last quarter, there was even a scene of curry and green dancing together on the sideline under the music. Finally, the warrior won in the third quarter with Curry's victory.
