On May 2, 2021, according to Meiji, the Cleveland Cavaliers will sign a 10 day contract with Anderson vallegio to allow him to retire as a knight.

It is reported that there are 17 players in the Cavaliers' team, which is full. So in order to sign Valerio, the Cavaliers will soon apply to the League for a difficult exception.
