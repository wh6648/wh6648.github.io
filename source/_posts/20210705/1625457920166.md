On June 21, the Bucks beat the hawks in the absence of brother Letterman and made it to the finals. They will compete with the Suns for the championship this season. From the strength point of view, if the two teams can keep healthy, then the strength is equal, but the Suns showed a more stable play in the western finals.

From the offensive point of view, the bucks in the whole playoffs have shown a more powerful offensive ability, not only the letter brother, in the letter brother absence and some critical moments, Middleton's play is also crucial, directly help the bucks to pass, will successfully enter the finals. If brother alphabet can return in time in the finals, brother alphabet will undoubtedly still be the starting point of the whole Bucks' attack. Facing the Suns, I'm afraid no player can completely defend brother alphabet. Although Aton's height and strength can compete with brother alphabet, he is hard to match in speed. The rest of the players, no matter Claude, who is famous for his defense, or Saric, who is a substitute, are hard to compete with the letter brother in height and strength, which makes the letter brother the strongest point of the bucks. If the Bucks choose to let the letter brother continue to recuperate, Middleton and hollerdy's impact on the basket, as well as the projection of the outside line will also bring some trouble to the Suns, but I'm afraid it's difficult to directly shoot down the momentum of the suns.

Compared with the Bucks, the Suns are more abundant in the offensive end. Booker and Paul show strong ability in the playoffs. Whether it's personal scoring or organizing teams in series, they can help the Suns bring great threat to their teammates in the offensive end. Booker's attack ability needless to mention, whether it's outside projection, or after the breakthrough directly hit the basket, all let the Clippers in a mess. In addition, Paul is not old this season, especially with the Clippers in the last game, the second half contribution of 31 points, directly let the Clippers into a desperate situation. And in addition to these two people, Aton's cover directly under the air with bridges and Penn's piecemeal, has also become a headache for the opponent's defense. Compared with the Bucks, the Suns are more aggressive and more difficult to guard against.

On the defensive side, the bucks are gifted, with the long arm monster crowd headed by the letter brother, making the opponent repeatedly blocked in the impact of the basket. In addition, such as Middleton, hollerdy, Tucker, are good defensive players, not only through physical fitness to give the suns the biggest challenge of attack, but also through a positive attitude and rich experience to maximize the Suns to prevent easy scoring. However, if bucks want to limit the play of Booker and Paul, it's not easy. They can only make a choice between limiting scoring and limiting the connection with teammates.

On the other hand, although there are not many well-known defensive players in the league, if you carefully observe the Suns' lineup, such as Paul, bridges, Aton and so on, they are also excellent defensive players. In the series with the clippers, the Suns also successfully limited the Clippers' play at the offensive end, and played back many times through successful defense, Then Booker or bridges complete the attack by slamming or layup. Of course, although the Suns played well in the series with the clippers, it was also due to the absence of Leonard to a certain extent. Facing the bucks with the letter brother, I'm afraid it was the real touchstone to test the Suns' defense.
