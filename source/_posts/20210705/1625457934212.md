On June 21, the Bucks beat the hawks in the absence of brother Letterman and made it to the finals. They will compete with the Suns for the championship this season. From the perspective of lineup, each team has its own strong points. Who can gain the upper hand through the advantages of the lineup still needs to wait until the final is announced.

First of all, in the back line, the bucks in the introduction of hollerdy, so that the overall strength has been greatly improved, in the play can complement each other with Middleton. Before that, Middleton was the most dazzling player in the Bucks' backcourt, not only able to provide stable pay in the defensive end, but also the three-point ball has become one of the sharpest weapons to kill opponents. However, the Bucks' attacking power in the backcourt is still a weak part of the team. After the introduction of Halliday, the Bucks' backcourt offensive ability has been greatly improved. Halliday can not only provide a strong ability to impact the basket, but also have certain projection ability and organizational ability, so that the Bucks' backcourt can further share the pressure of the letter brother. And although huoledi and Middleton are already all star level match, but I'm afraid it's still difficult to compare with the Suns backcourt.

Compared with the Bucks all star level backcourt combination, the Suns' backcourt combination can be regarded as super giant. Paul can be said to be a phenomenal point guard. When he first entered the league, he showed great talent. No matter in scoring ability or organization ability, he can be said to be a point guard rarely seen in the League for several years or even more than ten years. And after this season came to the Suns, Paul is still young, not only to help the suns in the offensive end of the attack will comb more smoothly, but also at the critical moment of the game, through their own cover after the breakthrough of the sudden stop jump shot to complete the stable end, it can be said that the Suns can enter the finals and Paul's play is inseparable. In addition to Paul, Booker, as an extremely terrible scorer, has been upgraded this season. After his partner Paul, Booker is more involved in the attack of the tandem teams than in the end, which makes it more difficult for opponents to guard against him. The continuous scoring at the critical moment also reminds people of the horror of his scoring ability. The performance of their combination in the playoffs can be said to be the best in the league.

In the front, if the letter brother can return in time, then the Bucks will occupy the absolute advantage. From the physical talent of brother Letterman, I'm afraid it's difficult for the Suns to match their strikers. Letter brother in the League after a firm foothold, there will be a big step into the storm button signboard action. This is also due to his outstanding physical talent. For almost all teams in the league, it is difficult to find a successful player to effectively limit his physical talent. After several years of struggling in the league, the offensive skills of brother Letterman have also been greatly improved. He can not only finish long-range shots in the outside line, but also attract the ball to better teammates after the breakthrough. These improvements undoubtedly make brother Letterman more threatening in the offensive end. In addition, Tucker, as another starter of the Bucks' front line, can provide as much help as possible on the defensive side. In the series with the nets, he has been pestering Durant and helping the bucks to eliminate him.

In contrast to the Suns, although the combination of Claude and bridges is very practical, both of them are 3D players, and bridges also has excellent physical talent. He can always be seen when the Suns launch a fast break, and Claude is more stable outside the three-point line this season. But the two are hard to compare with the letter brother, in the finals, the two or will become the Suns lineup in the biggest short board.

In the position of center, Lopez is like a tool man. At the offensive end, it can create as much offensive space as possible for teammates, make way of the forbidden area, so that teammates can safely break in, and its long-range ability can also make the opponent fear enough, dare not easily shrink the space. In addition, on the defensive side, Lopez's blocking is the last line of defense in the Bucks' penalty area. In recent seasons, Lopez's blocking has always been its most iconic feature.

On the other side of the Suns, Aton's role is similar to that of the tool man, but it is obviously stronger than that of Lopez. At the offensive end, the high cover of Aton is the standard configuration for Paul and Booker to launch the attack. Stable cover can give enough space for the combination of outside lines, and timely down can let Aton get a lot of easy scoring opportunities. It can be said that without Aton's high-quality cover, the attack of the Suns will be difficult to support the team to enter the finals. On the defensive end, the protection of Eaton in the basket and the blocking as the last line of defense can also give the team the greatest help. The protection of the backboard in the back court allows bridges and others to get a lot of opportunities for direct fast break.
