On July 5, the competition of men's basketball team in 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games came to an end this morning.

In the four competition areas, the teams who finally broke through to get tickets were Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and Slovenia.

In Slovenia's victory over Lithuania, Luka dongqiqi was very powerful. He scored 31 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists. He played for 33 minutes and made 13 of 23 shots. His efficiency was also very high.

In addition to Dong Qiqi, the most competitive players in the other three divisions are all NBA players.

First of all, molitz Wagner of the German team, you know, this season, the development of the third grade Wagner in the NBA is extremely not smooth. Throughout the season, he changed three teams. In the wizard, he played 25 games, averaging only 15 minutes, with 7.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.3 assists. After that, he was traded to Celtic and only played nine games before being cut.

Later, Wagner was lucky to sign a contract with the magic until the end of the season, and the situation finally improved. In Orlando, he played 11 games, started 10 times, averaged 26 minutes, got 11 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists.

It's such a player who has become a marginal player in the NBA. After returning to the German national team, Wagner became a big killer in the interior. In the key battle that decided the ticket ownership today, Wagner went out for 28 minutes and made 9 of 12 shots, including 3 of 6 three-point shots, 6 of 6 two-point shots, scored 28 points and 6 rebounds, 1 assists and 3 steals, leading Germany to beat Bassi 75-64. His talent is expected to continue to release in the future Tokyo Olympic Games.

Coincidentally, in the Italian team, there is also a player who has similar experience with Wagner. As a rookie, Nico mannian has little chance in the warriors this season. In the regular season, he has played 30 times on behalf of the warriors, averaging 12.1 minutes per game and getting 4.1 points and 2.3 assists. Most of the time, mannian can only hone in the development alliance.

However, in the Italian team, manien's situation is completely different. In fact, as early as in the youth team, manien made his debut in the Italian men's basketball team. Today, when he comes to the adult national team, he is still the main attack point of the team. In this game, Italy won 102-95 in the face of several main players such as Jokic, and manien also made the first contribution. He got 24 points and 4 assists.

In another match, the Czech team won the final Olympic men's basketball match by beating Greece 97-72. Czech core guard Thomas satolanski scored 12 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals. Led by him, the Czech team had four men in double and successfully defeated the Greek defense.

Although satolanski is not a key figure in the bulls, he is undoubtedly the leader in the Czech national team. The reason why the Czech team can get better and better in this Olympic Games playoff is also relying on satoran's stable play, playing the ball, and the life and death battle with Canada, that is, he finished the final in the last moment by shooting a cricket shot. You know, Canada has eight NBA players.
