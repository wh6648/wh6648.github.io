On July 5, Chris Paul led the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals, the first time in his 16 year career. There's no doubt it's special for him and the Suns, who now have a chance to win his first championship and improve his status as the greatest player in history. Mark Aguirre, a former NBA all star and champion, said he believed Paul had the ability to lead the Suns to the championship and that he was the most valuable player in the NBA.

"At the moment, Chris Paul is the most valuable player in the league. I watched the kids play, and I watched what Chris Paul made of them... They're playing identity now. They know how to play, they play their way... I'm very impressed with him... I think they can win the championship, really Mark aquill said.

There is no doubt that Paul's leadership is indispensable to the team. As a veteran, he has many years of experience in the playoffs. The Suns need Paul to keep them at their best and lead them to the championship.
