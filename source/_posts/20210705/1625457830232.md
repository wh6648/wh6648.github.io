On July 5, according to Sports Illustrated reporter Chris Mannix, Damien Lillard and Bradley bill are the two stars Boston Celtic should pursue this summer.

The Celtics entered a very busy off-season. After failing to compete in the East this season, they began to take action to catch up with the Brooklyn nets and Milwaukee Bucks. After the departure of Denny green, they were linked with players who had been hard to find before. Recently, the names of the two big stars have appeared in Celtic's target, and people have begun to wonder how to get any of them.

"I think two players will let Celtic trade Jay brown. One of them is Bradley bill. If Bill wants to renew his contract with the wizards, he will have to make his own decision in the next few weeks. If he doesn't renew his contract, it's equivalent to applying for a deal and he can be traded. And we all know that bill and Jason Tatum have a good relationship Chris Mannix said.

"The other is Damian Lillard. Lillard's future in Portland is uncertain. If the Blazers decide to trade Lillard in the next few weeks, I think Boston will be in a very good position to offer a good offer including Jay brown. So, you can't just trade him to change the situation, but if one of these two players can trade, I think you have to seriously consider trading Jay brown Chris Mannix said.

Although the free agent market is not as pleasant as we thought before the start of the season, the trading market always brings a lot of surprises to the league. Celtic have made some big changes, even swapping kenba walker for Al hofford, but obviously it's not the only big deal they've made in the off-season.
