On July 5, it was reported that the Pacers made an application to the 76ers to trade brogdenga's first round draft right for Simmons, but it has been rejected by the 76ers.

Simmons' performance in the playoffs disappointed Philadelphia. His poor shooting ability hindered the 76ers from going further in the playoffs. Simmons himself said on social media that he would get better in this off-season, and even missed the upcoming Olympic Games, but that doesn't mean he will stay in Philadelphia.

According to people familiar with the matter, Simmons' agent will not take the initiative to seek a deal until the 76ers make a decision, but other teams have begun to offer Simmons an offer.

The 76ers have made it clear to Simmons that if they want to trade Simmons, they will trade him as an all star player. That led them to reject a deal with the walkers, which includes Malcolm Brogden and the first round draft.
