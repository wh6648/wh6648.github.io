On July 5, although the eagles lost to the bucks in the G6 Eastern showdown yesterday and missed the finals, their performance this season was almost beyond everyone's expectation. All the way through the cut will enter the dongjue, which represents the past nobody care about the young team, officially into everyone's sight. John Collins, one of the Hawks' core players, wrote in the star stand, outlining how underappreciated they have been along the way. The following is the translation of the full text:

Dear Atlanta,

I've been one of those "others" almost all my life.

Do you know what I mean? I'm not a prodigy like some people. I'm not a genius. I'm not a five-star high school student. No blue blood school has recruited me. I haven't been included in any training camp. For example, my first video may only have 5000 views, half of which came from my mother. As for basketball dream? Man, when I was growing up, my basketball dream was just a dream.

Then I seized an opportunity, it was my summer vacation before senior three. It's "I know a coach, he knows a coach, that coach knows other coaches..." in this case, someone owes someone a favor, who owes someone else a favor, and so on. I don't even know how it happened, but I was in a hurry to attend a summer camp invitation called nbpa top 100, which was a big basketball show.

I'm surrounded by future NBA players. I remember fox dunking one of the hardest dunks I've ever seen in training camp, when the best players of our age were there. All these people, and then I - John Collins. But I also have my own advantages.

Let me repeat, because to this day I am still proud of it: I have my own advantages. I realized that summer camp was a very precious opportunity and I had to make it meaningful. So, I try my best to compete, and I find myself in a completely different condition. I'm playing with something that five-star high school students lack - to prove myself.

Interestingly, once you have something to prove, it never goes away.

So seven years on, you've got me on a team - all the people who want to prove themselves? We all stick to the same goal up and down the team? Well, let's get straight. It's not a very ordinary team.

I don't want to stand between them and the target.

During the whole journey of the playoffs, everything was crazy, watching everyone try to figure out what to do with us. During the regular season, we didn't have a lot of live broadcast in the United States, so I don't think most people really saw our game. In addition, we have never had a lot of dramatic things here, so we are not the focus of discussion. Or the old story: we are not the chosen ones.

We are "others.".

Remember G1 in the first round of the playoffs, it was a crazy day. What I've been hearing is, "the Knicks are back!" They have all this momentum, the whole audience chanted "fuck you trade" and saw the predictions that "the Knicks will win seven games.". All the focus and eyes belong to New York. We are just the humble Atlanta. That's their energy. It's cool. It's good for them.

Then we beat them hard.

The second round is the same story. See a lot of comments, such as: what's wrong with the Knicks? Do the 76ers want to play bucks or nets in the next round? Again, however, we hit in the face. Win G1 and tell them Atlanta says hello.

Even after we beat the first team in the East, people still think we are just "lucky to be here." So and so of the 76ers were injured, and so and so were not able to shoot. That's what everyone was talking about in that series. At the same time, we just care about ourselves, fly to Milwaukee and try to win another G1 away.

That's what I love about this team.

We are a fearless team. You may have more stars than us, or more hype than us, or more playoff experience than us, whatever it is, but you will never scare us. Because we know that no matter what happens at any time of the game, we just shoot back.

Lots of shots.

It all starts with trejan, and you know his data. But in fact, it's everyone's efforts, it's me, it's Kevin huert, it's Capella, it's Bogdan, it's Luwei, it's Gallinari, everyone we play with is a weapon.

It's everyone.

And the last key factor - and I think the biggest reason the team is here - is that we like each other. It's true. It sounds simple, but it's true.

We really like each other.

That's why Schulte can score 27 points in one game and Trey young can score 48 points in the next. You may not know which game it was, but you can remember their performance. That's why you can see that there is such a strong connection between the veteran and the young in our team. As an important topic in the playoffs, it may be Capella's first time to reach the finals in his career, or Gallinari, etc; Or how we can help Lewy get his first ring. It's a trivial matter, but I think it can show something.

That's why, as an unofficial senior executive of the eagles, every one of my teammates and I have a very private, very elaborate, very confidential handshake ceremony.

Like me and redish, we always talk about things on social media together. Have you seen this video? Have you seen that video? So when we high five, we scream, "shheeeeesh!" This is popular on the tiktok. Kevin and I, every time we clap high fives, I ask him, like, what do we smell tonight? Is it the taste of victory? I even high five every coach now.

It all feels good to be able to boost morale, all of which are important. Can prove that we are a collective, we share each other's success.

For me, that applies to all hawks fans.

Yes, we lost G3. Yes, we are now 1-2 behind£¨ Eagles lost to bucks 2-4 in the final and missed the finals.)

We may still be the "others" in this story, and we are definitely at a disadvantage in the playoffs. To be honest, my mom might still contribute half of my viewing of the game video. Some things will never change.

But I think this is also the special part of this journey. We use our way, the way of Atlanta, with originality, with hard work, with culture, to improve ourselves. We have nothing to fear and still have something to prove.

We don't just win for the city, we win on behalf of the city.
