On July 5, according to hoops wire's Sam Amico, the pelicans are one of many teams interested in trading for Lok Fu.

The conflict between Lefu and Cavs has been going on for a long time, and it broke out completely in the second half of the regular season. Lefu is very likely to leave Cavs and go to a new team in the off-season.

Pelicans still have a bad season with Zion and Ingram, which makes them doubt their lineup.

According to reports, a number of teams, including pelicans, have expressed interest in Lok Fu. These teams include the 76ers, the heat, the clippers and the Blazers. But at present, Lefu has not applied to knight for a deal.

Rover's salary will reach $31.2 million next season and $28.9 million in 2022-2023. Steven Adams's total salary for the next two seasons is $35 million, while Eric bradso's guaranteed salary for the next two seasons is $22 million. If his contract can be fully guaranteed, this number will rise to $37.4 million.

Theoretically speaking, Lefu can make up for pelican's weakness in shooting outside, thus opening up more space for Zion. But on the other hand, Zion and Lok Fu are not good defenders, when they appear on the court at the same time, pelican's defense system will be difficult to establish.
