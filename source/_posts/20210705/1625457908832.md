On July 5, it was reported that Charles Barkley, an NBA star and former Phoenix Suns legend, supported his old club to win the NBA finals. However, Barkley also knew that it was easy to say and very difficult to do, especially if adtokumbo recovered and played for Milwaukee Bucks.

In a recent show, Barkley talked about the Suns' dilemma in the finals, especially pointing out that the health of adetokumbo is a key factor, and stressing that if adetokumbo returns - if not 100%, then the Bucks will be hard to beat.

"If I return to 85-90%, I will choose Milwaukee, but I will wholeheartedly support my Phoenix Suns." Barkley said on the show.

"Charles Barrick chose the Bucks instead of the suns in the NBA Finals and pressed the guarantee button," Arizona Republican reporter Duane Rankin reported

Indeed, it's not surprising that the bucks are favored because they have more playoff experience and a more balanced lineup, and they can come forward when they need to. The Bucks also proved this with practical actions. When the letter brother missed the last two eastern finals due to knee injury, the Bucks still successfully ended the eagles. Letterman's current state is still under daily observation, but media reports say he will be allowed to play if he reaches seven in the finals.
