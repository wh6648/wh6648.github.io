Lawrence, President of Los Angeles Clippers - Frank and general manager Michael - ARS ии ne Wenger has put forward veteran Luis - Williams to Atlanta Hawks , In exchange for champion defender Rajan - Rondo , At present, the team's record has obviously recovered , It's a very good reinforcement. that , What does Rondo mean to the Clippers ?

Last season, the Clippers' internal struggle was fierce, mainly the contradiction between the old clippers (rivers, Rowe, Beverly and Harrell) and the new clippers (Leonard, George and Reggie). The Clippers management is accommodating the superstars, and Leonard and George have many privileges (especially regular season "load management"). The old clippers had entered the playoffs by relying on the civilian system in the 19th season, and they had no credit or hard work. They were dissatisfied with the privilege of the double stars. Conflicts between the two sides always broke out in the Western Conference semi-final, George and Harrell openly infighting, the clippers were eliminated by the Nuggets, and the Lakers "our boat is not coming yet.". Since then, Harrell and rivers have left one after another (rivers joined the 76ers, but also scolded George across the air), the old clipper line left only two Dewey and Beverly. After terenlu took office, he gradually weakened the tactical position of Lu Wei, and finally Lu Wei picked up the burden and left. This is the first significance of Rondo's coming here, which is political significance. The old clippers have collapsed, and the players' sense of identity and trust in the team have been further strengthened. (editor's note: the two stars were also suspected to be in conflict last season, because Leonard trainer Clint parks publicly ridiculed George's problems and Harrell was a spy. But it's been fixed this season.)

Longduo's long distance rescue is more of strategic and tactical significance to the Clippers. After succeeding rivers to become the Clippers head coach, Taylor Lu made a drastic reform in his coaching philosophy. The offensive end no longer relies on singles, but mainly focuses on space basketball. The joining of Ibaka, Batum and Kennard, and the growth of Mann greatly improved the team's projection ability. The ball team was opened up by players, and Leonard, Batum, George, Dewey and Reggie held the ball alternately, The players are all involved in guiding the ball to get the scoring gap. Space basketball improves the team's attack, and the attack efficiency is as high as 117.3 (close to the net). The team is mainly engaged in positional warfare. The number of rounds is 97.8 (27th in the League), and the deceleration is to ensure the success rate. The team's hit rate is 48.5% (4th in the League), and the three-point hit rate is 42% (1st in the League). Limited by sports ability, the team did not play much fast break, averaging only 10.6 points per game (26th in the League). After Harrell left, the team seriously lacked the ability to attack the basket, averaging 42.5 points in the field (28th in the League); the team relied on projection, averaging 13 points in the field (5th in the League), 43.2% in the field (8th in the League), 11.3% in the field (6th in the League); 14.4 times in the field (5th in the League), 37.7% in the field (5th in the League). Although the attack efficiency is high, but when the team's three-point depression, it is extremely difficult. In addition, although everyone of the Clippers shared the ball, they did not have a top organizer. Sometimes they fell into a situation of Space Jam and star single challenge, which affected the stability of their performance. This is also the reason why the Clippers had a high performance and a low performance before Rondo came.

Old clipper tie Lu Wei became a chicken rib player, his scoring ability is good, also has the bright display, but after old fellow Harrell leaves, his pick and roll level plummets, also weakened his tactical function, in addition, his defensive end is too bad. The growth of Mann makes the strategic value of Luwei go down again, and finally Luwei is marginalized in exchange for Rondo.

Rondo has a historical organizational vision and helped the Celtics in 2008 and the Lakers in 20 to win the championship. Last season, he was the No.2 field control in the Lakers, leading the way of the Lakers. There were many problems in the regular season (poor three points and poor defense), which made coach Vogel suffer from media attacks and doubts. Fortunately, Rondo's playoffs restored the style of "post-season Duo" and helped the team win the championship. During the off-season, he got 15 million yuan for two years to join the eagles, but he was not in a high mood and went into the state of fishing, which failed to bring much help to the team. Therefore, the hawks and Clippers trade can be described as a win-win situation, hawks in exchange for Lu Wei, increased the substitute firepower, the team under the guidance of Michael Milan's record.

For the clippers, Rondo's joining provides a new solution: his top pass vision can comb the team and optimize the team's attack; he can ease the organizational pressure of Leonard and George, so that they can spend more energy on the attack.

From the data point of view, Rondo averaged 7 points (47% of hits, 44% of three-point hits), 5.1 assists, 36.6 passes per game, and 15.5% assists, including 7.8 passes, 38.5% of hits; 8.6 passes, 57% of hits, and 48% of hits. It can be called a high-quality passer. As Rondo came on as a substitute and partnered with George in the transition period, he passed the ball to George the most, accounting for 23.3%, which can share George's holding pressure.

Rondo also plays a role as a coach on the field. Although teren Lu is a master tactician, he can't play in the game after all. Rondo commands the overall situation on the field and can spread out the contents of the white tactical demonstration board on the field. Rondo, in the king's time, commands corsin to run and prevent an opponent's attack, which is an example.

Of course, we should not elevate the position of Rondo too high. Rondo is only a backup guard after all. He has obvious defects: the projection is put, which is not conducive to the development of space basketball to a certain extent; his defense is poor, which may be called by the all star guard or the front line; his performance depends on Lai's physical ability (Rondo always has a rule that the first ten games after his recovery are like the possession of God, and then he is in the doldrums).

There are several chronic problems that Rondo can't solve

First, the team attack basket is too bad, relying on projection. Although Rondo can attack in series, but also break through the organization and secondary organization, the team still has to rely on projection to solve the problem, and the situation of relying on hand feeling has not changed.

Second, the team's double stars Leonard and George are not top-notch in their ability to serve the ball, so it is difficult to punish them by name as James plays guard and curry plays center. They are more likely to play hard in singles, which is a war of attrition. In the playoffs, they lose too much physical strength, which is not conducive to the collapse of the opponent's defense. George's stability is another worry for the Clippers, In recent years, George has been in the doldrums in the second half of the regular season and the playoffs. It's unclear whether he can break through the bottleneck this year.

Third, the Clippers' defense system is not bad. The defense efficiency is 110.7 (10th in the League). The team has many versatile players who can change their defense. They set up a change of defense and joint defense, and rely on enthusiasm and strength to ensure defense. Although the defense efficiency fell to more than 20 at the beginning of the season, they gradually recovered their sense of defense.

However, in addition to a few players such as double stars, Beverly and Ibaka, the team lacks sufficient defensive talents. Whether the players can withstand the high-intensity test of the playoffs is a question mark. The clippers and the players who may be called in the playoffs, such as Rondo, Reggie and Kennard, are defensive loopholes and are often called by All-Star players; Morris Jr. can only head the small forward, but there is nothing he can do when he meets the call; although zubaz is strong in protecting the basket, his defense can only stand on the stump and squat in the pit, but he can't prevent it, so he may be called by the defender. Center configuration and basket protection is a difficult problem for the team. Center Ibaka is the best choice. He can throw and protect the basket, but his defense can't match the peak period, and his playing time is limited. Zubach is strong in basket protection, but he may be called. Mo is good in offensive space, but he is poor in basket protection. However, in the west of the clippers, the Jazz suns trailblazer Lone Ranger has strong guards who can punish the Clippers' guard line; Nuggets yorkie is good at trampling the Clippers' interior line; the Lakers' Jamie can be named both inside and outside, and the Clippers' defense system is still under test.
