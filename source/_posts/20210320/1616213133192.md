March 20 news, from the NBA reporter Michael - scoto's report, informed sources revealed that the nets about Spencer - Ding Weidi's trading offer exposure.

The source said that with the closing date of the trade (March 26) approaching, the Nets' asking price for Ding Weidi is a role player who can make a contribution on the bench this season, plus a second rotation.

Obviously, after getting James Harden through the trade in January this year, the goal of the nets this season is to win the championship.

It is pointed out that it is reasonable for a team without salary space to trade for Ding Weidi, because in this way, they can get Ding Weidi's Bird rights, so as to renew Ding Weidi's contract in the off-season by way of salary cap.

Shortly after the start of this season's regular season, Ding Weidi suffered serious injury due to cruciate ligament tear. After the operation, he is now in the stage of recovery. It is reported that Ding Weidi is expected to fully recover before the start of next season.

According to previous reports, the heat and pistons have expressed interest in getting Ding Weidi in the deal.
