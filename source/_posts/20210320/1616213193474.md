March 20 news, NBA regular season continues, the following is part of tomorrow's game Outlook:

Hawks (21-20) vs Lakers (28-13) (03:30)

The Atlanta eagles have become one of the most competitive teams in the League since they took over their employer coach Lloyd pierce and assistant coach Nate McMillan on March 1 local time. The eagles' current record is 7-0. They come to Los Angeles with the momentum of 7 consecutive wins, which is the longest consecutive win in the league and the longest consecutive win for the eagles since January 2017. It's worth mentioning that the Hawks will go through an 8-company trip next, and Los Angeles is their first battle.

"We just play one game after another and we will do better in the next... Every game in the second half of the season is very important and you have to lock in and take advantage of every game." Coach McMillan said.

Trey young is still the catalyst of the eagles, with an average of 25.9 points and 9.4 assists per game. The return of center Capella has also greatly improved the team's defense. In addition, tomorrow's game against the Lakers is the first time Rondo has returned to Los Angeles to play against his old club since the Lakers won the NBA championship in Orlando park last year.

Like the Hawks, the Lakers are in excellent form. They have won four games in a row since the end of the all star weekend. What's more profound is that the Lakers did it without Anthony Davis and mark Gasol. Davis has had a little training, the Lakers will reassess Davis at the end of the month, and Gasol Jr. has lifted the ban and can play against the Hawks tomorrow. It is worth mentioning that the Laker substitutes Kuzma, Harrell and tucker have recently brought great help to the team. The three can contribute 50 points in March. In addition, LeBron James also continues to play efficiently. In the past three games, he has won three doubles in two games. In March, he can contribute 28 points, 9 assists and 7.6 rebounds per game.

Wasp (20-20) vs clipper (26-16) (10:00)

The goal of the Hornets is to end their 10 game losing streak against the Clippers tomorrow. Since February 28, 2009 local time to beat the Clippers by 100-95, the Hornets have never won the Clippers from Staples Center arena, it is worth mentioning that at that time, lamello Bauer was only 7 years old. The 19-year-old is already on the Hornets' show, scoring more than 20 points in seven of the past 11 games. He is also the team's third scorer. In the last game against the Lakers, ramelo Bauer scored 26 points and seven assists.

"It's a good feeling to play here, but it's also a pity because we didn't win... The whole team knows we have the ability to compete, we know what we can do, what we have to do is to unite and play hard." Ramelo Bauer said.

The clippers, on the other hand, are not in good shape. They have lost eight of their last 13 games. They have been 10-11 since February. They are also looking for solutions to the problem. In the last 89-105 defeat to the lone ranger, the Clippers scored 9 of 32 three-point shots and 6 of 11 free throws. 89 points was also the second lowest score of the season.

"The lack of trust between the offensive players, did not do a good job to share the ball, personal strong play more, offensive choice is not reasonable." Clippers coach Talon Lu is very dissatisfied with the team's performance.
