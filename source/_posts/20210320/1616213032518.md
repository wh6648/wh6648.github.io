Owen's attacking efficiency has been the first of this season. For Owen, it is a season that he may embrace history and his own, and rectify his name. On March 20, 2021, the nets lost 113-121 to the magic and Owen scored 43 points.

In this season's list of offensive efficiency, Owen topped the list with 121.5 points, surpassing Leonard and Jokic. It's incredible that Owen played such brilliant offensive efficiency as an Owen this season, which also shows how strong Owen's ability as an offensive master is. After the opening, Owen continued to show himself on the offensive end. The first attack was to face Gordon in a wrong position, cross and turn over the backhand layup in one step, and finished 2 + 1.

Then Owen in the bottom corner of the left side, holding the ball back to the body single, in the person almost fell to the ground before the high difficulty of pitching, magic in this game played a very perfect start, but Owen in the offensive end is really too no solution, his all kinds of extreme style like open hanging shot, is the reason why the nets in the opening outside line is not allowed to bite. In the middle of the first quarter, Owen turned 360 degrees to get rid of the three men's bags and lay up to stop the magic team.

In the second quarter, the nets fell into the biggest crisis. Harden fouled three times ahead of time, which made Owen open his own attack mode again. Continuous single challenge helped the nets catch up with 3 points from 12 points behind. In the last few minutes of the second quarter, Owen even started his personal show, constantly hitting, three points, two points, step back, backward. Under the magic team's half-time three-point pitch of nearly 60% crazy attack, just like the rainstorm against the wind, one person even hit six single challenges, including the nets, the last six attacks in the half, and 24 points in the half.

After the second half, Owen once again took on all the attacks of the net, because harden was completely abandoned because of the foul problem and the referee's competition. The attack of the net fell into unprecedented passivity, and he had to rely on Owen to score again and again. In the last minute of the third quarter, the net was 17 points behind, and Owen finished the 2 + 1 layup again by himself, keeping the hope of chasing points in the last quarter.

Entering the last quarter, Owen came up again and hit the backward center shot. At this time, the net had caught up with 4 points. In fact, they were 19 points behind in the last quarter. But at the end of the game, Owen's hand feeling and physical fitness also had problems. All the pitchers in the net were dumb. Owen was unable to stand on his own and the net lost to the magic.
