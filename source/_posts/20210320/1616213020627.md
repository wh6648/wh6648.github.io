James Harden has made the nets the hottest team in the East. He is the gold oil of the team and the biggest favorite of MVP. On March 20, 2021, the nets lost 113-121 to the magic. Harden scored 19 points and 9 assists. He was completely chopped up by the referee's blow.

In the latest MVP list, harden has risen to the sixth place, but in fact, harden is the hottest one recently. All his data are at the top of the league. What harden is doing is the best to make a team better. However, at the beginning of the game, although harden had a good layup and made fouls, he got into a passive position because of two personal fouls.

In the second half of the first quarter, harden came on the court again and broke through again to send assists. One time, harden had an open shot in the outside line. The whole court, including his teammates, thought harden was going to shoot three points. Unexpectedly, harden directly assisted brown to lay up easily in the inside line. This time, he cheated eight people. Harden's progress in defense in recent years has made him undertake a lot of misplaced defense tasks after joining the nets. This is harden's rare winner now. However, at the beginning of the second quarter, harden got his third foul, which was the first dilemma of harden's game.

What I didn't expect was that at the beginning of the second half, when harden was just improving on the offensive end, when harden was defending fornier, he was directly punished for stealing. At this time, harden even stamped his foot, saying that the ball was one of the players, and immediately asked Nash to challenge the penalty. Results after the challenge or adhere to the original decision, harden again the rhythm of this game was all chopped by the referee. At this time, the magic began to score continuously, while harden's attention turned to competing with the referee - constantly looking for physical confrontation, with the referee is not to whistle, the net was 17 points behind.

In the last quarter, harden came on the stage and directed an 11-0 climax. The nets directly caught up with 8 points from 19 points behind. Harden made continuous assists during this period and finally began to put his head out of the water. In the last four minutes of the last quarter, harden made a three-point return shot and still kept the chance to chase the points. However, in the last few minutes, harden didn't get anything. In the end, he didn't lead the team, lost the game and ended the winning streak.
