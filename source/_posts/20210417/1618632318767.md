On April 17, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued. The Philadelphia 76ers are at home to the Los Angeles Clippers. At the end of the game, the Clippers lost 103-106 to the 76ers, ending their 7-game winning streak.

In addition, this is George's fifth consecutive game, scoring 30 +, equating his personal career record. In addition, his total score in the regular season also exceeded 14000.

Away against the 76ers, for Paul George, is a different mood, after all, in Philadelphia bench, Doug rivers or clippers coach last season. After all, after the Clippers' flurry out last season, rivers' conflict with George became public after class.

George once questioned rivers' use of himself, and rivers also hinted that it was George himself who failed.

Such a war of words, the best solution, of course, is through the game. Especially this night, when Cary continues to take turns and George leads the team, his chance to fight back against Li naturally comes.

However, after all, the 76ers are the top super teams in the East. After the opening of the first quarter, they quickly set off a climax with the help of enbid. In just four minutes, they have already led the Clippers 20-3.

Passive, George also shot a three-point ball, but, in the opponent's tight interference, he is playing iron most of the time. Prior to this, clippers coach Lu guidao had said that he hoped George could get more easy shots, rather than blindly holding the ball and fighting with the other side. However, in the case of small card does not play, pickled pepper is inevitable for Philadelphia, he received the ball, the ball, shooting, do all kinds of technical movements are very difficult.

You know, this season, the clippers have had many crashes, routs. But in this game, even if they were behind by a big score at the beginning, George was blocked by Philadelphia, but the gap with rivers gave pickled peppers extra motivation.

In the latter part of this section, when the feeling of the outside line is not good, Paojiao is no longer obsessed with projection. He decides to drive full power and continue to kill the inside line. Philadelphia obviously can't cope with George's toughness and his rapid adjustment. In the latter part of the first quarter, after a successful breakthrough, George easily scored double, and the Clippers also successfully stopped the momentum of losing points.

After the game, although the Clippers are still behind, but the difference has been narrowing, George continued to carry the team attack, continue to "carry the explosives" to the opponent's penalty area again and again. In the whole half, he only scored a three-point goal at the beginning, reliable and sharp breakthrough, and his personal score was close to the top 20.

Yi Bian fought again, and the Clippers' counterattack became more fierce. During this period, George's three points recovered and began to hit a string of goals. Not only that, he could also send accurate passes to his teammates again and again after attracting the clips. At the end of the third quarter, when Philadelphia pounced on George from the outside, he was given the chance to shoot in the middle distance. He hit two more goals and scored 15 points in a single quarter. Also in George's drive, the difference returned to a round gap.
