April 17 news, although the Philadelphia 76ers are currently ranked first in the East with a 38-17 record, some people think that they are still not the real championship contenders, but Ben Simmons does not think so, he believes that as long as they can keep the first position in the East, the 76ers can win the NBA championship this season.

"Yes, the guys will say 'yes, we won'. For example, I won't say which team. Someone said to me, "Damn it, we're just trying to get into the playoffs.". If you don't believe you can make it to the playoffs, how can you win the championship? I think we really believe that we're here to win the championship, and that's the only reason we're here. That's why we want to dominate the game, we want to be the best team Ben Simmons said in an interview with GQ.

"If we can be number one in the East, we will have home court advantage in the playoffs, which is very important for us, especially the fans will come back to the stadium. So I think we can do that this year. " Simmons said.

When asked to beat the nets by a narrow margin without Kevin Durant and James Harden, Simmons said, "can you feel it? (laughter) it's like saying, 'Hey, I got 100 points, but can you all win?'" no, at the end of the game, no one went to see it. Yes, the nets came back at the last minute. You can also say that Durant and harden were not present, but we just beat them Simmons said.
