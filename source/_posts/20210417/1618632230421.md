One day ago, the NBA came the news of extreme amazement and infinite loss. LaMarcus Aldrich, the All-Star power forward of the nets, suddenly announced his retirement without warning, ending his 15 year career.

After all, Adele has only joined the nets for more than half a month. If everything goes well, he will be able to go with the team to fight for the first championship in his career. However, for those who are really familiar with Adelaide, this decision reveals some inevitability in the accident

In fact, the heart problem that led to Adelaide's retirement is an old problem that has plagued him for many years. One is that Adelaide had a congenital heart disease when he was born. Later, Adelaide's childhood, teenagers and the whole basketball career were covered with the dark cloud of the disease.

After entering the NBA, Adelaide has a recorded history of heart disease for a total of three times. The first time was in 2007, when Adelaide, a rookie, underwent surgery for atrial fibrillation; in 2011, Adelaide underwent a second surgery for a similar problem; in 2017, Adelaide, who had been transferred to the Spurs due to arrhythmia, entered the injury list again.

However, Adelaide's outstanding enough, his diligence, his humility, and his first-class delicate skills in the interior completely offset the negative impact of heart disease. In his 15 years of career, people will not equate the title of "heart fighter" with Adelaide's name most of the time. In most days of his career, the league's top power forward is Adelaide's most appropriate title.

Adelaide's NBA career began in Portland. Although, in 2006 when he was selected, he was not favored by industry experts because of his thin body and limited athletic talent, he gradually replaced Zac Randolph and grew into the inner core of Bocheng with the patience of the team and the inclusive team of pioneers.

After nine years of playing for the pioneers, Adelaide left a lot of marks in the history of the team. He averaged 20 + points for five consecutive years and 20 + 10 points for two consecutive seasons. In the playoffs, he also played two consecutive 40 + games to break the famous game of the Rockets' interior. In the year that he left Portland, he was No.4 in appearance, No.2 in scoring, No.1 in rebounding and No.1 in double doubles. The last two records have not been broken until now.

But in Portland's nine years, Adelaide also has regrets, he five times with the team into the playoffs, the best result is only to play to the second round, in Adelaide's side, his partner changed from Brandon Roy to Damian Lillard, but, this kind of inside and outside double star configuration, but has never been able to help the developers to achieve the expected height.

So, in 2015, when aduh was 30 years old, he had the idea of running away for the first time. In his opinion, young Lillard is not enough to be a long-term partner in the future. He needs a new environment, a more stable team with more Championship details, better coaches and better comrades in arms.

After several trade-offs, Adelaide chose San Antonio Spurs, Greg Popovich, the godfather of basketball, and Duncan, Parker and Ginobili. For this new journey, aduh was full of vision, but what happened later was obviously very different from his expectation.

Joining the Spurs in the first season, Adelaide's data showed a straight decline, he can only get 18 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. In popovic's system, he is required to participate more in the rotation of the ball right, to do more coordination and to share the ball. This is quite different from the way he fought in Portland.

At that time, the Spurs were preparing to support "little card" Coway - Leonard as the new core of the team after the retirement of GDP. Popovich's ideal is that the team with the small card as the core can still continue the glory of the Spurs for another 10 years, or even longer. At that time, Adelaide was only the second leader in the Spurs' new system, and he was only the assistant of Cary after he succeeded.

Adelaide is not a selfish player, for Popovich's arrangement, for the new owner's role, he also gave full trust. And joined the Spurs in the first two seasons, Adelaide with the team into the playoffs, a semi-final, a western experience is always better than Portland period.

So, in the summer of 2017, when the Spurs asked for a new contract, Adelaide did not hesitate too much and accepted it willingly. But later, accidents happened one after another Xiao Ka suddenly fell out with the Spurs and played a long soap opera of training strike, match strike and missing. And with the departure of the small card, the Spurs completely faded the aura of the past, reduced to hovering on the edge of the playoffs.

However, in the most difficult period of the Spurs, Adelaide showed a real core attitude. His average score returned to the level of 20 + and covered the team's shame with magical individual performance again and again. In his 30s, he frequently gave high scores, even 40 + and 50 + were not mentioned.

But cruelly, from last season, when the Spurs completely turned to reconstruction, when Popovich brought a new group of young people, ready to make a comeback from scratch. Adelaide suddenly lost his position in the Spurs, his elegant offensive skills become unable to display, on the contrary, his slow pace, his disadvantage in running and jumping has been infinitely magnified, becoming the weakness of the opponent. When the Spurs' tactics were forced to adjust, Adelaide had to make a new choice with the change of the team

In the past six years with Spurs, Adelaide has done his best. But after all, he is not Duncan, not the three elders of GDP. When the team decided to embark on a new construction route, he gradually became a burden of innovation in the holy city. So, with the last trace of stubbornness and the last wisp of championship dream, Adelaide, at the age of 36, is determined to leave the Spurs and go to the nets to try again.

Unfortunately, the fate is really unfair. Less than a month after Adler came to Brooklyn, he had to make another difficult decision in his life. After suddenly choosing to retire, Adelaide left many regrets. First, he was unable to achieve the championship with the team. Second, the total score of his career was only 49 points away from the landmark of 20000. In addition, whether Adelaide can be selected into the hall of fame has also become an open question. Now, because there is not enough trophies in his whole career, he is likely to be stuck out of the hall of history.
