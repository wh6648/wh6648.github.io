April 17 news, Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard spent a very good season, recently in an interview, Lillard said he should get the 2021 MVP.

Obviously, Lillard is tired of not being loved by the fans and the media like other players. He has found the way to MVP. It depends on how he ends the season. He has a good chance to win this award. In a recent interview with ESPN, the host talked about Lillard's chance to win the MVP and why he thought he was not as popular as other stars. Lillard said that he played in a small market team for a short time, which affected his chances of gaining more recognition in the league.

"I'm not a loud talker. After I've done everything, I won't go out to celebrate, I won't make crazy statements, people will get tired of being the same. If you look back at my career, you can see that every year I improve in some way, I find a way to make my team win, and I'm not surprised. Don't do anything crazy to attract people's attention. I just need to do my job well. " Lillard said.

Lillard believes he has a solid reason to win the MVP and explains why people don't think he's good enough to win it.

"They'll see how I'm defended and in some games I can't even shoot. Oh, yes, sometimes when I get 15 or 14 points, I may make 4-for-10 shots, because I really can't find the basket. Others are not being defended like I am. If someone thinks I'm not, they're not watching Lillard said.

"I think this year is more dominant than ever, I think I deserve it (MVP), that's the truth." Lillard added.
