On March 19, NBA records reported that the Lakers intended to sign free agent Thomas Jr.

"Physically, I never thought I would have that feeling again," Thomas said in a social media post. That's why I smile every time I practice and play. God is so kind to me

"It's said that the Lakers and bucks are interested in signing Thomas Jr. in the league," noted Jon krawcynski

Before the trade deadline in 2018, the general manager of the Lakers, palinka, got Thomas, Frye and a first round signing from the Cavaliers by sending Clarkson and NANs away. The contract to send Clarkson off gives the Lakers room to sign two top paid players. James joined the Lakers in the summer of 2018.

Thomas Jr. was highly efficient in 17 games for the Lakers. He came off the bench most of the time and averaged 15.6 points and 5 assists per game, which was comparable to the super sixth man Lu Wei that season. After that, due to the hip injury, Thomas Jr. lost the season.

In February 2020, the Clippers got Thomas Jr. from the Wizards through a trade, and then cut him. After that, Thomas left the NBA, but he kept trying to get back to the NBA.

As an attempt to return on the pitch, Thomas joined the U.S. national team in the 2021 Copa America qualifier, scoring 14 points in both games, 6 of 12 three-point shots.
