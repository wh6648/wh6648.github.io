On March 19, in an interview on ESPN La 710, Laval Bauer talked about the future of New Orleans Pelican star ronzo Bauer in the team. The father said that ronzo Bauer should not stay in the pelican team, and he did not like the way he was playing.

Asked if ronzo Bauer should stay in New Orleans, he said: "no, no, he can't stay in New Orleans. Come on, man. Ronzo's always been an organizer. Why do you try to turn him into a corner shooter and a defensive expert? Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram have never been an organizer in their careers. You try to change that. Now do you want to put the ball in their hands and become an offensive organizer? Go score and do what you have to do, If an organizer does not play the right offensive tactics, it will be difficult for them to win every game

Although ronzo Bauer's scoring and shooting data have improved this season, his father is very frustrated by the decline of his assists. Dad thinks ronzo Bauer can help Zion and Ingram score easily, but in dad's opinion, pelicans prefer Zion and Ingram to control the attack.

When asked if he thought the deal really happened, the father said: "Oh, I don't know what they will do, but I hope he (ronzo Bauer) can be traded. The problem is, I don't like watching him play like that."

Despite the great success of both ramelo Bauer and ronzo Bauer this season, the father still believes that his three sons should play in the same team.
