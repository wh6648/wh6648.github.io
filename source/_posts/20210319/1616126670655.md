On March 19, according to US media reports, raptors do not intend to trade Lori this season.

According to reporters, the Raptors have told Lori's team that they don't plan to trade Lori before the season's trade deadline. Lori himself has been told by the team that he will probably finish the season with raptors.

Although the Raptors said they would not trade him, Lori is still one of the most popular players on the market. The six time all star will be a free agent at the end of the season. The Raptors have lost six games in a row, falling out of the top eight in the East.

This is also the ninth year of his career in the Raptors. This season, Lori played 33 games, averaging 17.8 points, 7.5 assists, 5.6 rebounds and 1.2 steals, with a three-point shooting rate of 38.6%. He led the history of raptors in three points, assists, steals and triple doubles, and recently surpassed Chris Bosh to become the second place in the history of raptors.

Although Lori, 34, did not completely deny the possibility of being traded this season, he said in an interview in early March that no matter where he was before, he would retire as a Raptors player.

"I'm going to retire as a Toronto Raptors player, either on a one-day contract or whatever."
