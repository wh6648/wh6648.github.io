On March 18, the Clippers lost to the lone Rangers 89-105 away. After the game, George expressed his dissatisfaction that he didn't have a whistle.

Despite the fact that he has not been one of the key players in the NBA, he has always been frustrated that he has not played against the Clippers. George thinks the clippers have been playing very confrontational, he hopes the clippers can send the game video to the League for research.

"We put a lot of pressure under the basket," George said in a post game interview. "We don't have sentinels, which is really crazy, but that's what it is. This is nothing new for me. I hope we can send some videos in the past. The League needs to see. "

However, the lack of free throws was not the main reason for the Clippers' defeat. The decisive factors in the game were their three points of 9-for-32 shots and Dong Qiqi's 42 points and 9 assists. But the lack of favorable decisions has always been a frustrating topic for the Clippers this season. George frequently broke through the penalty area in the game and made physical contact with the defender, but he always complained that he didn't get the referee's whistle.

But George admits it's also a trend throughout his career. He averaged 4.5 free throws last season and 4.0 this season. These figures are significantly lower than his average of 7.0 free throws per game in the 2018-19 season.

Speaking about the referee after the game, Leonard also mentioned an attack of the game: "they watched my dunk failure for 30 minutes, and everyone saw him hit my hand."

"Once we get to the free throw line, we have to hit it. But tonight we only made 6 of 11 free throws. I'm mainly responsible for that. It's my fault Leonard said that in tonight's game, Cary made one of four free throws. "We need to move on, don't worry about it, play stronger, hit our layups and throws."

"To hit every shot you make is the only thing we can do." He added.

Although the lone Rangers only got one more free throw than the clippers, they made 10 of 12 shots, while the Clippers made 6 of 11.

"I mean, our job is to be aggressive, to attack." George said, "we can't do more than that, right? If they don't blow, they won't. That's the worst part, because we're not players who dive, we're not players who throw their bodies at other people

Of the 27 all star players this season, George is the ninth in the penalty area for shooting fouls, while Cary is the 14th.

Earlier this season, George thought diving was "bad for basketball," but he also thought players who were good at diving had the ability to get whistles, calling them "offensive geniuses."
