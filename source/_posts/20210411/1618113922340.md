On April 11, NBA famous reporter Jonathan Sherman issued an article today, talking about the renewal of Miami Heat player Victor oradibo's contract.

According to previous reports, oradipo's right knee was injured in a dunk against the Lakers, and the test result was negative. Subsequently, the heat officially announced that oradipo, due to knee injury, will not accompany the team to participate in the next four consecutive west road trip to further assess his injury.

So far this season, oradibo has averaged 19.8 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game. After joining the heat, oradibo has only played four games, averaging 12 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game. Reporter Jonathan Sherman said in an article that considering oradipo's injury and on-the-field contribution, it's getting more and more slim to get a contract close to the top salary with the heat or any other team this summer, whether in terms of terms, annual salary or length of service.

It is worth mentioning that oradibo has a chance to get a good contract extension. The Houston Rockets offered him a two-year $45 million contract, but oradibo refused the contract.
