On April 11, according to ESPN reporter Adrian wojnarowski, former MLB star Alex Rodriguez and billionaire Marc lore will buy the Timberwolves from Glen Taylor, the largest shareholder of the team, for about $1.5 billion. The deal also includes the acquisition of WNBA's Minnesota Bobcats, according to a team spokesman.

"We are looking forward to entering this stage with Glen Taylor and we have great respect for him and the team he has built with a bright future. "It's amazing that the Timberwolves and their fans can get to know this team Alex Rodriguez and mark Lowe said in a joint statement.

Adrian wojnarowski added that Glenn Taylor will remain in charge of the team for the next two seasons until Alex Rodriguez and mark Lowe take over in 2023. Taylor bought Timberwolves for $88 million in 1994 and the new Bobcats in 1999. For most of Taylor's time in charge of the team, the Timberwolves are one of the worst performing teams in the NBA. They have only entered the playoffs once since 2004, but the Bobcats have achieved more success in their 22 seasons, winning four WNBA Championships during this period.

Alex Rodriguez, a former MLB superstar who has won MVP three times in his career, tried to buy the New York Mets. Mark Lowe is the president and CEO of Wal Mart e-commerce group. He and Rodriguez are very close friends. It is worth mentioning that Kevin Garnett, the legend of Minnesota Timberwolves, once intended to buy this team. Taylor also negotiated with Garnett's team, but the two sides did not reach an agreement in the end.

Glen Taylor says all negotiations are based on keeping the team in Minnesota. In addition, famous reporter shams followed up, and several sources revealed that Timberwolves will continue to stay in Minnesota.
