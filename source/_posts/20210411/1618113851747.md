April 11, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continues, the Los Angeles Lakers away challenge Brooklyn nets. At the end of the game, the Lakers beat the nets 126-101.

In this game, the Lakers side, a total of 8 people scored double, the team into 19 three-point shots, three-point shooting rate as high as 55.9%.

The Lakers continued their mourning posture when they played the nets away.

Although, the nets side, harden also high hanging exemption card, but Durant and Owen's double star combination, but enough for them to parry. Before the game, the media generally looked down on the purple gold army, but after the game started, the war situation was beyond most people's expectation.

The first quarter, the Lakers feel amazing, Schroeder long-range scoring, Horton Tucker and big Morris's three-point ball also hit steadily. In the interior, Zhuang Shen gradually formed a tacit understanding with his teammates, eating cake to attack the basket, hitting and shooting continuously.

On the contrary, on the other side of the net, the momentum is completely down.

In fact, the Lakers have been playing hard in almost every game since James and bro were injured. But in adversity, the role players of the purple gold army have grown rapidly. Back to the game, the first quarter later, the Lakers continue to work, guard Schroeder shoulder the offensive flag, he scored 11 points in a single quarter. In the second quarter, he used the three-point ball to build up a 10 point advantage for the Lakers.

Although, the nets rely on Owen and Durant's power, successfully in the second quarter to achieve super, but the situation changes, but did not affect the mood of the whole team, they are still in an orderly manner to promote their own plan. During this period, Schroeder fell to the ground and hurt his back when he grabbed the ball, but after a short adjustment, he quickly returned to the field, which greatly boosted the morale of his teammates, and in the score, the Lakers also achieved a counter super.

Of course, the Lakers can always occupy the advantage, on the one hand, they are tenacious enough, on the other hand, they also need some extra moves.

When Yi Bian fought again, there was an accident on the field. At that time, Owen and Schroeder were angry when they were in opposition, and they were not giving in to each other. Although the referee on duty gave each of them a technical foul, they still didn't shut up. As a result, unable to endure the chatter of the two, the referee simply expelled them directly.

Schroeder's end, of course, has an impact on the Lakers, but in this "pair" process, the nets are obviously the more affected side. With Owen's exit, the net attack completely power off, although Durant insisted on staying on the field, but KD, who has just recovered, has a clear limit on the playing time.
