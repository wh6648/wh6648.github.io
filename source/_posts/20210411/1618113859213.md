On April 11, Scott Pippen, son of NBA veteran Scott Pippen, announced on twitter today that he will participate in the 2021 NBA draft. According to reports, Pippen has no signed agent, so he can announce his withdrawal from this year's NBA draft at the latest on July 20.

"We all have dreams, and I'm ready to pursue them." Little Pippen tweeted.

Previously, ESPN ranked the top 100 players in the 2021 NBA draft, but Scott Pippen was not among them. Last season, Pippen II averaged 20.8 points, 4.9 assists and 1.8 steals per game, leading the team in all three data.

Coach Jerry Stackhouse also fully supported Scott Pippen II's candidacy in an interview. "He showed great improvement during his time at Vanderbilt University. His record season is just a glimpse of his potential. We want Scott Pippen II to make the best decision for him and his family, and we will do our best to help him make the choice. " Coach Jerry Stackhouse said.
