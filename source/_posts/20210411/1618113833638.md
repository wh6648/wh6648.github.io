There is no old opponent and old teammate James, but Owen's performance against the Lakers is still worthy of attention. On April 11, 2021, the Lakers beat the nets 126-101. Owen scored 18 points and only played half-time. He was expelled at the beginning of the second half.

After Owen and James broke up, they played each other for six times. James won four games. During these six games, James scored 29 points, while Owen scored 30 points. So even if James can't play in this game, Owen's defeat of "James' team" is still of great significance. Although the first shot failed, and was played by the Lakers climax, but Owen soon misplaced to Zhuang Shen hit three points.

Although the Lakers gave up super defense in the first quarter, Owen didn't eat your game at all. Whether it was facing the misplaced single challenge or a pair of face-to-face box attacks, Owen was still gorgeous to no solution. Three minutes in the first quarter, Owen faced Tucker and attacked directly with the ball. He moved left and right. After a false turn, he forced himself to pull back. He threw back almost against Tucker's hand. This shot actually greatly boosted the team's morale.

In the fifth minute of the second quarter, the Lakers opened the scoring gap again to 10 points. At this time, it was Owen's third misplaced face with Zhuang Shen. After looking for confrontation in the air, he glided and staged a double handed loop, bypassing Zhuang Shen's defense and flying from the left side to the right side for layup. This goal can be regarded as one of the best attacks in Owen's career. After that, Owen bravely staggered to face Morris's defense. As a result, he was directly knocked down by the opponent with his elbow and chin, creating the opponent's first-class malicious foul. These attacks and defences brought back the rhythm of the net, and Owen led a wave.

At the beginning of the second half, Owen even spammed rubbish with Schroeder, and finally let the referee pull away. The accident happened in the second half nine minutes, Owen just ate a technical foul, did not expect to be directly called a technical foul by referee No. 35, two consecutive technical fouls even directly expelled Owen. In fact, Owen played the best game in this game. After the blow, Owen even rushed to the referee for a time and couldn't control his mood. Finally, he was persuaded to leave. Finally, the nets lost the game in a panic.
