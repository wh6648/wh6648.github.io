On June 5, the Los Angeles Clippers faced a life and death battle on the road. In the end, the Clippers beat the lone Rangers 104-97 with Leonard's 17 points in the third quarter and 45 points in the last quarter, rewriting the total score of the series to 3-3. The two teams will also usher in the first round of the only seven game.

In the game, Dong Qiqi and Leonard all opened fire. Dong Qiqi scored 11 points in the first quarter of the game. After that, although the score did not increase too much, he used himself to attract defensive assists to score. By the end of the third quarter, he had gained 10 assists. On Leonard's side, although only 3 points were recorded in the first quarter, he scored 13 points in the second quarter and 17 points in the third quarter, helping the Clippers to surpass the score.

Next, the two teams will be the first round of the only seven war, although the two teams in the past six games have paid all, but in the seven war, the two teams are afraid to completely let go.

In the Clippers side, although the team has Leonard and George, and both have a lot of highlights in the game. However, the two did not seem to exert their full strength in the whole series, and they often have reservations. For example, in the fifth World War, although George's fourth quarter firepower was fully opened, Leonard was very depressed. In the sixth game, when Leonard made a continuous strong attack in the second and third quarter, George failed to make a continuous strong attack, which also made it difficult for the Clippers to make an explosive performance, so that the lone Rangers could keep on biting the score.

If the clippers can go all out in the Seventh World War, George and Leonard will be in full swing. In the paper comparison of the lineup, the Clippers will still occupy a certain advantage. In addition, sitting on the home court, the Clippers will directly occupy the advantage of the location.

On the other hand, the lone ranger team, although the superstar in the team is only Dong Qiqi, in the whole series, no matter polzingis or Hadaway or Finny Smith, as well as brenson on the bench, all gave a wonderful performance in the game, and such a multi-point flowering plus Dong Qiqi's outstanding organization and transmission ability also made the Clippers' defense a little stretched.

In the fight for seven, if the lone ranger players except Dong Qiqi can keep their heart full play and help Dong Qiqi share the pressure, it will definitely be a disaster for the Clippers. I'm afraid that even if the Clippers' double stars are fully open, it will be difficult to easily get a substantial lead in the game.
