It is reported on June 5 that the Brooklyn nets will play the Milwaukee Bucks in the eastern semi-finals. This is a series with all the elements of the playoffs, a series that can be remembered. Today, Nets coach Steve Nash talked about the game with bucks in an interview.

"There is no doubt that this round of the series may be remembered." Nash said, "we will see how it is presented. The bucks are no less than any team in the league, and we have enough talent to match any team in the league. That's to see who's playing better, who's more persistent and resilient, and who's ahead in this series, and then look at the other side's reaction. On paper, you can see that this is a classic set of duels. Let's see who will win and whose rhythm, timing and performance are more acute. "

The nets played an epic offensive performance in the first round of the playoffs against Celtic, scoring 128.0 points per 100 rounds, far higher than 117.3 points in the regular season. The bucks are in the top 10 defensive positions in the regular season, losing 95.4 points every 100 rounds in the four games series that swept the heat.

Due to injuries and various problems, the nets have tried various lineups this season. So manager Nash has been emphasizing the importance of building cohesion and continuity, and said to continue this cohesion into the playoffs.

"This is a real problem, and it is also a real problem we have to face. We're trying to piece together all the pieces, and that's our challenge. I think it's normal to be asked these questions, and my answers to these questions are honest and credible. We accept that, it doesn't matter, we don't run away, we don't make any excuses, I don't want to get any excuses from our staff, players or anyone. This is the gap that our team is fighting. Every team has their shortcomings and needs to grow. These are our first problems Nash said.
