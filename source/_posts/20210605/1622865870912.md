On June 5, the NBA playoffs continued to fight fiercely, in which the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Dallas lone ranger 104-97 and tied the total score to 3-3, extending the suspense of the series. Guard Reggie Jackson can be called the Clippers "thigh", he got the team's second highest 25 points and 9 rebounds, but his fourth quarter continuous "blind move", also nearly led to disaster.

Overall score 2-3 behind, the Clippers face the risk of elimination, and the first quarter clippers "dual core" Leonard and George are not in the state. In this case, guard Reggie Jackson became the Clippers' thigh.

This round of series, Reggie Jackson is obviously playing better rhythm. After two points in the first game of the series, the Clippers starting point guard scored 15 + in the next four games.

In the first quarter of the game, Reggie Jackson played 12 minutes. He made 6 of 8 shots. One man scored 14 points alone. One man's contribution exceeded the sum of "dual core" Leonard and George.

Jackson helped the Clippers through the difficult first quarter. When Leonard found the rhythm of attack in the second quarter, Jackson voluntarily handed over the offensive power. However, Reggie Jackson's contribution did not stop.

A lone ranger team shot, Reggie Jackson rebounded, in the face of Dong Qiqi's close press, he cleverly made a successful foul, let Dong Qiqi get a personal second foul. But at the end of the half-time, Reggie Jackson limped in the attack, then he was replaced and went straight back to the dressing room.

Good news, Reggie Jackson's injury is not very serious, the third quarter back on the field. When George appears very hesitant at the offensive end, and Leonard scores alone without help, Reggie Jackson becomes the most effective assistant around him.

He hit his third three-point shot, scoring 20 points in three quarters, second only to Leonard's 33 points, and equaled his own scoring record in this year's playoffs.

However, in the fourth quarter, Reggie Jackson's offensive end was not calm, he broke through to the basket, the non ball holder blocked Dong Qiqi, and the referee blew the offensive foul. In the first three quarters, Jackson only had 1 turnovers, which could be said to be very awesome.

However, in the fourth quarter, Jackson did not seem to be able to play. At the end of the quarter, he made three mistakes and increased the number of individual fouls to five, which almost caused the Clippers to be overturned because of his "stupid move".
