June 5 news, Minnesota Timberwolves star Malik Beasley will have to watch the rest of the NBA playoffs in prison... According to the famous gossip media TMZ confirmed that Beasley has entered the prison in Minnesota to serve a sentence of 120 days.

According to TMZ, Bisley was originally scheduled to serve his sentence on May 26 local time, but a court official said it was eventually postponed to June 1. According to prison and court officials, Beasley was taken to Minnesota's Wright County prison on Tuesday local time for a 120 day sentence.

In September 2020, police in Plymouth, Minnesota, received a call to the police. A couple and their 13-year-old daughter drove an SUV to park in front of a house in the suburb of Minneapolis. Bisley came out of the house, banged on the window with a gun and asked them to leave immediately. Since then, police intercepted a car trying to leave the house at the scene of the incident and detained three people on board. In the process, a man who claimed to be the owner of the house (Beasley) kept yelling at the police. Police then searched the house and found 1.8 pounds of drugs and many guns. Looking at the surveillance video, Bisley left the house with a rifle.

After that, Beasley was arrested by the police and charged with two felony charges of violence and hiding drugs. Bisley pleaded guilty, and his charge of hiding drugs was revoked in exchange. He was sentenced to 120 days in prison, which he can serve.

It is worth mentioning that before, Bisley's relationship also changed greatly. His love affair with Pippen's ex-wife, Larsa Pippen, was exposed. There was a 22-year-old age difference between them. However, Bisley has publicly apologized and been forgiven by his wife.

Although Bisley's off-site disturbance is unceasing, but the forest wolf is very optimistic about this young man's future. The two sides have previously reached a four-year $60 million contract extension, with the last year as the team option. In the regular season, Beasley averaged 19.6 points.
