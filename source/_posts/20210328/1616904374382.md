On March 28, according to reports from US media, informed sources revealed that Al hofford will not play for the thunder this season and will miss the remaining 28 regular season games of the season.

Sources said that hofford plans to continue training with the thunder, but he will not represent the team. Not playing can reduce the risk of injury to hofford, so that the thunder team and I can find the next home more smoothly this summer.

Thunder general manager Sam Presti has promised that he will work actively with hofford's agent to find a team more suitable for him at the end of his career this summer.

In the 21-22 season, his annual salary was $27 million, while in the 22-23 season, it was $26.5 million, of which $14.5 million was guaranteed.
