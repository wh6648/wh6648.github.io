On March 28, according to a report from "the Olympic", former All-Star power forward LaMarcus Aldrich will sign a one-year veteran's base salary contract with the nets after 48 hours of clarification, officially becoming a member of the Brooklyn luxury team. And after signing with the nets, Adelaide's career has opened a new page

In the summer of 2015, the warriors beat the Cavaliers to win the championship, announcing the beginning of a new dynasty.

The next whole off-season, the main line of the league is almost around the champion defending, Knight revenge.

That year, it was recognized as a small year in the transfer market. Among the top free agents in the first rank, there were only two names with less weight - mark Gasol and LaMarcus Aldrich.

Also that year, Adelaide was just 30 years old. He was selected into the all star team and the best team of the year in the just concluded season. However, in the first round of the playoffs, he was severely "hanged" by the Grizzlies and was defeated 4-1. As a result, after nine years in the service of pioneers, Adelaide moved the idea of leaving for the first time. In his opinion, young Lillard is not enough to be a long-term partner in the future. He needs a new environment, a more stable team with more Championship details, better coaches and better comrades in arms.

In the pattern of the League at that time, the San Antonio Spurs were undoubtedly the best. But that summer, Popovich was particularly interested in adelain.

Since the beginning of his NBA career, Adelaide has been a big man with a low profile. It is true that in 2015, he was recognized as one of the most reliable power forwards in the league. He averaged 20 + points per game for five consecutive years and 20 + 10 for two consecutive seasons. In the playoffs, he also played two consecutive 40 + games to break the famous game of the Rockets' interior.

But Adelaide is too low-key, for the off-season sudden hot attention, for the teams competing to throw the olive branch, for frequent NBA headlines, this shy big man is obviously not adapt.

However, in many pursuers, the same low-key spurs, won Adelaide most favor. You know, in order to win in this battle, the Spurs, contrary to the normal laziness in the off-season, led by Popovich himself, supplemented by Duncan and Parker, launched a high-profile lobbying for Adelaide.

At that time, the Spurs, Duncan were about to retire, Parker and Ginobili were in their twilight years, and the small card still needed to be honed. Therefore, Bobo urgently needed a star with excellent qualifications and fighting power to take over the power in the hands of GDP. Adelaide and the Spurs hit it off as soon as possible. Soon after the talks, the two sides signed the contract on July 10.

For this new journey, aduh may be full of vision, but what happened later is obviously very different from his expectation.

In fact, joining the Spurs in the first season, Adelaide's data showed a straight decline, he can only get 18 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. In popovic's system, he is required to participate more in the rotation of the ball right, to do more coordination and to share the ball. This is quite different from the way he fought in Portland. Of course, in the new owner, Adelaide is no longer the absolute core, he was reduced to second in charge, and became a helper around xiaoka.

Adelaide is not a selfish player, for Popovich's arrangement, for the new owner's role, he also gave full trust. And joined the Spurs in the first two seasons, Adelaide with the team into the playoffs, a semi-final, a western experience is always better than Portland period. So, in the summer of 2017, when the Spurs asked for a new contract, Adelaide did not hesitate too much and accepted it willingly.

However, things are unpredictable. After Adelaide successfully renewed his contract and even made preparations to die in the Spurs, in 2017-18 season, Cary suddenly had a conflict with the team. Because of his injury, the contradiction between the two sides gradually became irreconcilable. In the whole season, he only played nine games and disappeared in the late season. With the departure of the star in charge, the Spurs also faded the aura of the past, reduced to hovering on the edge of the playoffs.

On the contrary, in the most difficult period of the Spurs, Adelaide showed a real core attitude. His average score returned to the level of 20 +, and the Spurs formed some new tactics around him.

However, this rebound is only temporary. In the summer of 2018, when the dispute between the small card and the Spurs was finally settled, and when the Spurs traded with the Raptors in exchange for the current king of midfield, Derozan, the team's tactics were forced to adjust again. At this time, Adelaide has to make a new choice with the change of the team

It needs to be admitted that Adelaide's six years in San Antonio are dedicated. In Popovich's changeable tactical system, he has been trying to adapt and devote himself to it. In order to take over Duncan, Adelaide also learned some stone Buddha's playing methods and ideas, and tried to weigh carefully between pick and roll and low position attack. In order to adapt to the trend of the league, Adelaide strengthened his running enthusiasm, and developed a stable three-point range (three-point shooting rate of 38.9%) last season, turning himself into an efficient space interior.

However, for a veteran over 35 years old, such a change is still too difficult. This season, when Popovich completely abandoned the original tactical system, with a group of young people into the rush, Adelaide's day in the Spurs is also the end. This season, Adelaide only played 21 games, but almost every night, he will become the opponent dislocation attack weakness. In front of the new generation of players in the fast whirlwind, Adelaide has been unable to parry, even once reduced to a substitute.

Finally, Adelaide and Spurs break up, perhaps it is the status quo of extreme helplessness. For the Spurs these years, Adelaide, even if not too much credit, also can be regarded as a lot of hard work, considering this, the holy city is willing to start and finish, actively cooperate with Adelaide to find the next home.
