March 28 news, from the "New York Times" reporter mark - Stein reported that informed sources revealed that the Lakers and Celtics are seen as Andre - Drummond battle leader.

On Friday's trading deadline, the Cavaliers did not complete any deals with Zhuang Shen. In this context, the two sides reached a buyout agreement. After 48 hours of clarification, Zhuang will become a free agent.

According to previous rumors, Zhuang Shen will listen to the recruitment dialogue of the Knicks, the Lakers, the clippers, the green army and the Hornets. In addition, the nets team is also seen as Zhuang God's potential next home.

According to the tip that Stan got, the Knicks team, which had been favored before, is no longer the leader of Zhuang Shen's battle. In fact, in terms of salary, the Knicks can offer Zhuang Shen a four-year contract of $64 million.

If Zhuang Shen chooses a team with the strength to compete for the championship, such as the Lakers and the nets, they can only offer a veteran base salary contract. Considering that the nets are the hot spot to buy out the market, the Lakers are eager to get Chuang Shen.

Stan previously revealed that the Lakers are very optimistic that they will get Zhuang Shen.
