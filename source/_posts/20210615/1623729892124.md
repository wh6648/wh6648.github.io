On June 15, according to Adrian wojnarowski, a famous ESPN reporter, the source said that the NBA competition committee held a meeting today to further discuss the change of rules to restrict players' unnatural jump shots used to make fouls.

The NBA wants to limit players - including smart stars like Trey young, Luca donchic and James Harden - to avoid making fouls by leaning back or sideways. The NBA has shared with 30 teams a compilation of video examples of players making fouls, outlining some actions that are considered unnatural. According to the sources, the NBA and the competition committee will work with the league's general managers next week to study the specific unnatural actions, so as to find out the examples of being recommended to the owners to vote out next season. The competition committee plans to make recommendations and vote to the League Council this summer, and implement the rule changes in August, the Las Vegas Summer League and the 2021-2022 season.

According to reports, more and more people think that this is a common problem, and many of these tactics give the attackers too much advantage. While the focus of these issues is usually on star players with more possession and exposure, the League believes it's a common problem across the lineup and roster - not just superstars.

The NBA competition committee is made up of owners, general managers, coaches, players and referees - to a large extent, they basically agree that the existing rule framework allows offensive players too much free time to make physical contact in a way that is considered unnatural and awkward. The league wants referees to start changing the way they enforce the law in the summer league, sources said.
