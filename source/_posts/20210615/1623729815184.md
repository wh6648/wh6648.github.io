On June 15, the NBA playoffs continued. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Hawks, who returned to their home court, beat the 76ers 103-100 and tied the score 2-2.

The eagles had a fast pace in the opening stage and tried not to fall into the positional battle with the 76ers. They used Trey Young's series connection and relied on the excellent feeling of the outside line to get the start. The 76ers didn't blindly use the advantage of the inside enbid to open the attack when encountering the tight defensive attack. Instead, they relied on Harris's advantage in the front line to drive the multi-point flowering, with low position strong attack and free cut score, There are also three points of curry on the outside line. It is the diversity of the 76ers' tactics that helps them to play a wave of 16-2 climax and lead by 10 points. While the eagles can't keep up with the rhythm gradually when they lose all the sense of Trey Young's hand and are overtaken by the score.

In the second quarter of Trey Young's offensive recovery, leading the eagles to chase points, the attack comprehensiveness of the 76ers appeared again. The eagles' attack on enbid in the interior restricted the latter's play, but the 76ers had other tactical starting point and ending point. Harris and curry had three consecutive points. The 76ers used the efficient performance of fast attack and counterattack to expand the difference to 18 points. Three of the 76ers still scored in double in the first half, despite the restriction of enbid.

On the other hand, the eagles can only rely on other players to score piecemeal when Trey young is limited. It is difficult to keep up with the attack intensity and rhythm of the 76ers. And the 76ers' advantage in the interior is very obvious. They have an absolute advantage in rebounds. In the first half, the 76ers' rebounds were 33-23, 10 ahead of the Hawks, which also laid a good foundation for their lead in the first half.

However, in the second half, the 76ers tried to rely on enbid to open the attack, but the latter did not find the rhythm of the attack under the siege. In the whole second half, enbid lost all 12 shots, and the eagles took the opportunity to surpass the score under the drive of Trey Yang's sharp pass. In the final decisive moment, the key players of the two teams played different performances.

In the last minute, Trey young had a three-point assist, a throw and two free throws, leading the team to play a wave of 7-0 anti super score, while enbid's most critical layup still failed, and finally the 76ers fell short in the decisive moment.
