In the 2021 playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers lost to the suns in the first round, declaring their failure to defend the title.

The biggest reason for the loss of the Lakers is naturally injury. James has not fully recovered since he was sprained in his right ankle by Solomon, which has affected the level of breakthrough and defense. Thick eyebrow was affected by Achilles tendinitis all season, and compensatory groin strain occurred in the first round.

In addition, palinka, the team's senior manager, had a defective lineup, hoarded too many centers and failed to find a good player to hold the ball, and guard Schroeder failed to pass the ball well; Last season's champion coach Vogel fell off the chain in the platoon and on-the-spot command, especially infatuated with the double tower method. He failed to put Schroeder and Zhuangshen down to the bench in time, blocking the team's offensive space. He overemphasized the iron defense and affected the team's hand. The team's three-point Tielian relied on the attack basket to score, which led to the Suns' snatch.

It should be noted that last season, Vogel's platoon layout was decisive and resolute. Center McKee and Howard DNP played a small team. This season, they were infatuated with the twin towers and did not dare to send Schroeder to the bench. However, with the gradual exposure of the news, it turns out that Vogel also had to suffer. He was kidnapped by Schroeder and Zhuang Shen and lost control of the dressing room.

Let's start with Schroeder. Schroeder is the most important player this season. Theoretically speaking, as the third leader of the team, he can output firepower on the bench. On the bench, Harrell, the pancake eater, can play with Schroeder as a combination of clipper, Rowe and Harrell. It looks beautiful.

On December 1, he didn't expect him to give the Lakers a blow. He told the media: "I've been a substitute for the thunder for two years. I think I will try my best to move forward. As for James and thick eyebrow, I can help in the position of starting point guard, so LeBron doesn't have to think too much in his head. I can dribble to the front court, I can communicate tactics and so on, let him score. I think it's great to let him play without the ball, and I think that's why they brought me in. I think we'll fit perfectly Openly asking for a start put the team in an awkward position. It's obvious that he has to make a big contract in terms of performance and data in his contract year. But when he starts, it is not conducive to the integration with James, the superstar who also needs to hold the ball, the development of substitute Harrell, and the development of the tactics of the Lakers. Vogel agreed that he would be the starter, probably in order to "convince others with virtue" and let Schroeder retreat. Pelinka once regarded Schroeder as a future plan, and it was even rumored that she had promised Schroeder to start.

It turns out that this underestimates Schroeder's rebellious personality.

Schroeder twice refused to renew his contract ahead of schedule. Before the start of the season, he refused to renew his contract ahead of schedule by 33 million yuan for two years; On March 30, the Lakers refused to renew their four-year 84 million contract ahead of schedule. In the middle of the season, the Raptors planned to rebuild, the supermarket opened, and Powell was sent to the Blazers to make three shots. As Schroeder refused to renew his contract, palinka considered a deal. It is said that before the mid season trading day, the Lakers were very close to the completion of Lori's deal, but because the Raptors wanted to ask for potential stock Tucker on the basis of Schroeder and Pope's chips, so palinka finally refused the deal.

Due to James's accidental injury, the team was led by Schroeder, barely maintaining the record, ranking fifth in the western region, but it also strengthened Schroeder's voice, leaving hidden dangers for the follow-up.

Unfortunately, Schroeder was suspended for the second time due to the health and safety agreement of the league. As a result, there were only two runs left for the Lakers (the opponents were the Pacers and pelicans). The running in was not enough, the offensive space was not open, and they only relied on iron defense. It's a battle of life and death to play the warriors in the playoff, relying on James's three-point crossing.

In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers took a 2-1 lead against the suns; But the G4 suffered an unexpected groin injury, which led to the loss of the Lakers. In the battle of Tianwang mountain, Schroeder scored 0 points in 9-for-0, playing like a suns new aid, and finally the Lakers lost again. At the critical moment of the team, Vogel planned to adjust the lineup (after that, he added Zhuang Shen in G6), but at the critical moment, Schroeder once deleted the label of "Laker point guard" on instagram. However, G6 Schroeder was still in the starting position. He played poorly in the first half with only two points. It was too late for him to recover in the second half. The Lakers lost to the suns and were eliminated.

After the game, the magician of national father-in-law, a famous Laker, publicly attacked Schroeder: "I don't think he is a Laker. I don't know if the team will renew his contract, but I don't think he has the winning mentality and attitude we need. As far as I'm concerned, he's played a bad series "We have to bring in players who are willing to sacrifice in order to win the championship again," said Morris Famous Ramona Shelburne also revealed: "the Lakers met Schroeder's starting requirements, but his performance was frustrating." In the autumn of G6 crisis, it seems that Schroeder is still regardless of the overall situation and insists on starting, which causes dissatisfaction among the players.

In fact, Schroeder had a history of infighting during the Hawks' period. He once criticized the Hawks' bad strategy and said: "I'm a very competitive person. I don't want to be the bottom in the East. Of course, I have my own ideas. In other teams, I also have my own friends. For example, it's not too bad to go to the Pacers, and it's not bad to go to the bucks, You can say that their construction is in the right direction. " He also dropped his focus on the Hawks' official instagram and deleted every statement related to the Hawks. His teammate Prince once said in a meaningful speech on twitter, "he is obviously a soldier, but he pretends to be a general and shakes his head." The point of this remark is obviously at Schroeder.

In addition to Zhuang Shen, Marc Stein reports that when the Lakers recruited Zhuang Shen, they promised him a long-term starting position (the NBA also talks about human accidents, which is to extend their contract in the off-season), so the team did not hesitate to offend veteran Gasol. Pau Gasol once told the media: "I sometimes ask myself what I did wrong. I feel like I'm Plan D of the team." However, under the appeasement of Vogel, little Gasol also accepted the position of substitute or even water dispenser. It turns out that Chuang Shen's starting match doesn't match with thick eyebrow, but Vogel is still forced to insist on using it; It wasn't until G6 that he decided to DNP Chuang Shen. Chuang Shen thought about the overall situation and didn't cooperate. He was much milder than Schroeder.

In addition, Harrell was introduced by the full middle class, but due to the lack of the same passer as Luwei, his performance was unstable, and the arrival of Zhuang Shen made him often be recruited by DNP. After the team's defeat, he tweeted: "the worst feeling is a waste of time." Compared with his whistle blowing experience after the Clippers' defeat last season, he is unlikely to stay with the Lakers next season.

This is Vogel's second dressing room crisis. During the 2014 season when he was coaching the Pacers, with the departure of the changing room leader Granger, the old and new players had infighting, Hebrew bombarded his teammates for being "too selfish", Bynum disrupted the changing room, and Turner and Stephenson fought in the changing room. In the end, the powerful Walker disintegrated, and soon Vogel was out of class.

This is also the second time that James has encountered a dressing room crisis in his career: in the 2018 season, the Cavaliers' dressing room broke out a battle between new and old Cavaliers. In the off-season of 2017, due to Owen's request for a deal, the Cavaliers' management was forced to make a big deal and successively introduced Thomas, Claude, Wade and Ross. New Knights players such as Thomas want a big contract, Wade dissatisfied with the team's performance, and finally the firepower to the old Knights player Lefu, accused him of "cheating injury" in the game, caused a big infighting in the dressing room, and finally the Knights cleaned up new Knights players such as Thomas.
