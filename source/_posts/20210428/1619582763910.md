This is Owen's unpredictable performance. For Owen, without harden Durant, he has completely recovered his own rhythm of killing God. On April 28, 2021, the Nets beat the Raptors 116-103. Owen scored 9 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 steals and 1 blocks in only 3 of his 13 shots. In this game, Owen rarely became the team's lowest scoring player.

The improvement of defensive attention and enthusiasm is probably Owen's most recent evaluation. It's not only the improvement of steals, but also the increase of Owen's speed, times and frequency of pick and roll in two 45 degrees. In other words, Owen is performing the dual functions of himself and harden, which is probably the reason why Owen now embodies his value at both ends of attack and defense, Owen has even averaged nine rebounds, 10.3 assists and 2.3 steals in the past three games.

So after the start, Owen didn't even make a move. In the first four minutes, Owen used auxiliary defense and supplementary defense to fight against Lori. In the opening face of Lori's crazy attack and confrontation, Owen did lose rhythm. However, in the 25 games of his career against Lori, Owen won 15. Interestingly, this is the first time that Owen has played against Lori as a basketball star since he came to the net. In the first quarter, Owen lost his rhythm under Lori's strong confrontation. In a rare single quarter, he only sent one assist and made two mistakes.

In the whole half, Owen fell into a hand to hand fight. He won only once in sports and didn't get many free throws. However, he blocked once and led the way in the number of running and defending. Owen even started to follow his opponent in the back court. Half time 6 in 1, Owen attack end dumb fire has become a blockbuster defensive vanguard. However, you can never really lock up Owen's attack. At the beginning of the second half, he hit three points and central shots in a row, and feigned to attack Greene in the bottom corner after breaking through. The climax of one wave was over 10 points.

However, this is Owen's best performance in the first three quarters. The recent "fast" days really affected Owen's physical fitness. In the third quarter, he missed two close layups, which is Owen's sweet spot, but it is still unfinished. After three quarters, six rebounders scored double, but Owen only made three of his 13 shots, making a very inefficient offensive performance. But Owen's key defense in the last quarter gave the nets a lot of chances to win. It has to be said that Owen's impeccable defensive attitude is his biggest highlight. Finally, the Nets beat the Raptors in the away game, Owen played a "non European culture" game, with defense to help the team win.
