Durant as a substitute may become another new choice for NASH. After all, the nets have debugged nearly 40 lineups this season. As the first core of the team, how to protect and maximize his threat is the key. On April 28, 2021, the Nets beat the Raptors 116-103. Durant scored 17 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 steals and 2 blocks.

Nets and NASH are constantly to their own questions: the main starting lineup, and Durant in what position when to play, this game Durant in accordance with their requirements to return to the starting line-up, Nash again in accordance with the will of death to adjust the lineup.

However, in the climax of the opening game, 70% of the scoring and attack of the Raptors are carried out around the inside line, which makes the nets very unbearable. Durant can only play the blue collar role of mini center in the inside line many times. In the middle of the first quarter, the Raptor's eye saw a tendency to open the score. At this time, Durant finally drew his sword. First, he made a landmark mid shot in the bottom corner, and then he made a three-point shot against shaikam, which helped the nets stop bleeding.

After the second quarter, the Raptors gave Durant more fierce confrontation, but Durant still through unremitting counter run, moving to tear the Raptors defense. Durant fouled his opponent with a backrun from the baseline in the seventh minute of the second quarter. Durant had only two shots in the half, the lowest in the season. He became a feint point and misplaced defender, scoring 7 points and 6 rebounds. In the third quarter, Durant's attack was still in order, only hit three points in a few nodes, but the lethality was not enough.

There are only two free throws in the third quarter. In the face of the more fierce raptors, Durant didn't play better in the interior. The two free throws in the third quarter are far lower than his season average (7.1). But Durant is still Durant, Durant staged a key block in the last quarter, directly blocked anunobi's layup one-on-one, followed by a kill free throw, this time the net pulled the point difference to 10 points in the last 3 minutes, firmly controlled the situation.

In the last two minutes of the game, Durant showed the sickle of death. He completely defeated the Raptors with a landmark mid shot and three points in the bottom corner. After hitting the three points in the bottom corner, Durant also looked back at the Raptors' bench. The general meaning is: wash and sleep. Finally, the Nets beat the Raptors and continued to lead the East.
