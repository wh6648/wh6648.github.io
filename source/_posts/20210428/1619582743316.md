On April 28, NBA officials announced the latest issue of the list of defensive players. Philadelphia 76ers' Ben Simmons overtook Utah Jazz's Rudy gobel to the top

1: Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers, second place last week)

If this is an MVP list, the standard of ranking candidates is usually the degree of decline of the team's performance in their absence. It is worth mentioning that in the absence of Ben Simmons in four games, 76 people have lost the game. During the four consecutive defeats, the opponents of the 76ers were able to get 119.8 points per game, with a shooting percentage of 50%. When Ben Simmons came back, the 76 team's defense also returned to normal, they not only let the thunder get 90 points, three-point ball 30 shots only 7, and there were as many as 30 mistakes¡° I see a lot of things that most people don't see on the field Ben Simmons said.

2: Rudy Gerber (Utah Jazz, last week's ranking: number one)

The brain short circuit on the attack may make the team lose a good shot or an easy shot, but the brain spasm on the defensive side may make you lose a game. Unfortunately, that's what happened to Gabriel gobel, the favorite defender of the season. In Monday's game against the Timberwolves, Gabel's defensive error gave D'Angelo Russell an easy layup to complete the counter super, which led to the Jazz losing to the Timberwolves for two consecutive games¡° It's all my responsibility. It's the kind of game where you think you're stupid when you watch the video He said.

3: BAM Adebayor

In the heat's boastful team culture, when their winning rate is only about 50%, personal honor is not important at all, but they seem willing to make an exception to boast about Adebayor's defense¡° I think BAM (Adebayor) is one of the most unique defensive players in the league. He can defend from position one to position five. His defensive system is very reliable. He can accept different challenges, his super high basketball IQ can carry out a variety of defense programs, not only people think that he is involved in the change of defense, he can also lead his teammates to participate Heat coach Spoelstra said. Heat superstar Jimi Butler praised Adebayor for helping him on the defensive side as well.

4: Janice adtokumbo (Milwaukee Bucks, fourth place last week)

In the 38 year history of the defensive player of the year, 11 of them have been awarded to the winners of the previous season. Maybe adetokumbo can expand the number to 12. However, the biggest resistance of the letter brother may be the standard set by himself last year - this season, he limited his opponent's shooting percentage to 41.6%, which is 5.5% lower than his opponent's evaluation, but last season, he limited his opponent's shooting percentage to 36.2%. In addition, the letter brother all star after the defensive efficiency of 105.1, better than the Buck's 109.5. It is worth mentioning that last season, the two figures were 97.4 and 105.1 respectively.

5: Miles Turner (Indiana Pacers, ranked fifth last week)

In the 2020-21 season, Turner was absent indefinitely due to a torn plantar plate on his right big toe, while sabonis (back pain) also gave the Pacers the chance to choose a smaller team. They had won three games in a row before losing to the Blazers today.

6-10 (ranking in any order): Matisse Sebel (Philadelphia 76ers), og anunobi (Toronto Raptors), Zhu hollerdy (Milwaukee Bucks), Mike Conley (Utah Jazz), Marcus smart (Boston Celtics).
