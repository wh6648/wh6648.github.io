On April 28, Shaquille O'Neill, a famous commentator of the Lakers, said in the latest episode of "all the smoke" that he had been critical of the warriors superstar Stephen curry, but curry finally made him withdraw his words with practical actions.

O'Neill once said in public that curry was not suitable for their era, saying curry would be blown up before. And said curry is small and weak, no ability to lead the team. However, in the latest issue of all the smoke, O'Neill said that curry has been proving his remarks wrong, which is why curry has become the NBA's favorite player.

"Early in his career, I used to hate him," O'Neal said of curry on the show. "He can't do it," but he's constantly proving me wrong, and that's why he's the best player

"I like to be proved wrong, so I want to tell these young people: when I say something, you are going to prove me wrong." O'Neill said.

O'Neill also talked about Curry's influence on the basketball game, especially on the younger generation¡° For small players, curry is probably the most influential player, right? Because I see a lot of small guards - just like children, I can't do anything they can, good or bad Olney said.

Curry's recent performance is explosive. In the last game against Sacramento, curry made 7 three-point hits and scored 37 points and 7 rebounds. It is worth mentioning that his total number of three-point hits in a single month reached 85, setting a new NBA record. In addition, curry has hit 273 three points in 53 games so far this season.
