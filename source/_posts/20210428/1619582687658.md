On April 28, Houston Rockets head coach Stephen Silas talked about team star John wall and his first season as head coach in an interview.

John Wall's knee, ankle and Achilles tendon injuries took him two seasons to fully recover. At present, wall has suffered injuries, his hamstring injury is much more serious than the Rockets expected. An MRI scan on Monday local time showed wall had a hamstring injury, which usually leaves him out for about three weeks, while the Rockets are officially out of the playoffs and the regular season ends on May 16. According to previous reports, sources revealed that wall will miss the rest of the season because of a hamstring strain.

Rockets coach Silas said he is optimistic that wall will be able to play more frequently next season¡° I believe (wall will play 70 Games next season), but I'm not a doctor "In my opinion, he can really use this year to assess his own situation," Silas said. We can assess him in the same way. He doesn't have to spend another year trying to come back, he can take care of his body in the off-season. I think next year he will be better in terms of the number of battlefields, because he will have some time to rest and recover and become better. I'm sure in the past two seasons, he must have worked very hard to get him back this season and play in the data

Wall has played 40 games this season, averaging 20.6 points, 6.9 assists and 3.2 rebounds, with a shooting percentage of only 40.4%¡° He has proved that he can still be a very dynamic starting point guard and an excellent leader in this league. When we need him to play 40 minutes and contribute 30 minutes, he will stand up and devote himself to it "This year is a year to prove his return, and his future is bright," he said. In my opinion, next year may be better. "

In addition, Silas also talked about his first season as head coach¡° It's a challenge, but I love challenges and enjoy them. I know it's going to be a challenging job in a way, but I don't know we're going to have a season full of challenges. It's an incredible journey. " Silas said.
