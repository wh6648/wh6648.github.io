A few days ago, Chinese basketball star Zeng Fanbo gave up entering NCAA Gonzaga University and directly joined the NBA Development League to ignite the team, which has become a hot spot in the basketball circle.

Around Zeng Fanbo's "private" choice, all parties have launched a fierce debate, but also dig out some interest disputes. As a result, the future development of Xiao Zeng is more and more unpredictable.

In fact, Zeng Fanbo is not the only high school student who has been trapped in the difficult choice of basketball career in the past year. Originally, the 4-star and 5-star high school students on the national Scout system did not worry about the recruitment of famous schools. But last year, with the free time of the lockout, the NBA instigated a Development League selection team, which is called "ignite", to compete with NCAA's famous schools for jobs. As soon as the program was launched, it quickly moved the hearts of some young talents. In the past season, it has attracted five top high school students, including the 2021 draft hot Jay green and Jonathan cumminga.

Now, Zeng Fanbo has made a similar choice, skipping the University and directly entering the development alliance. Let's not talk about the domestic disturbance caused by this decision. There's another question that young stars like Xiao Zeng who dream of entering the NBA have to think about: which is the best springboard before the draft to develop the league or NCAA?

In the history of NBA, there have been many examples of direct draft selection after graduating from high school without going to college. High school identity players such as Kobe, Garnett, James, McGrady, Dwight Howard, etc. have also grown into dominant figures in the basketball world after entering the league.

But since 2005, with the NBA raising the draft threshold, most young people who want to draft must stay in College for at least one year to get the qualification, which is the so-called one and done mode. Although, there have been such confrontational policies as Jennings, moodier and "three ball" ramelo Bauer, who have been fighting overseas rebels. However, before entering the NBA, going to college first has almost become a common understanding of the "back waves" of basketball.

However, going to NCAA to play, of course, can infiltrate the humanistic atmosphere of famous universities. Besides playing basketball, it can cultivate one's character and broaden one's horizons. However, for most of the young players who aspire to enter the NBA, it is doubtful how much improvement they will have in their experience and knowledge outside basketball after a short stay. In the past two years, with more and more potential stars only using universities as transit stations, NCAA's appeal to them has indeed declined.

An obvious sign is that since Nongmei was elected as the number one champion of NCAA championship + mop in 2012, in the next seven or eight years, there are fewer and fewer popular rookies who are willing to take risks in March before the draft and lead the team all the way to the championship.

There are two indicators, which are more telling. At last year's draft conference, Duke, Kentucky, North Carolina and the University of Kansas, the four famous schools that have provided the NBA with the most talents since the 2010's, did not have a player selected in the Lotto area; In this year's crazy March, Duke and Kentucky didn't make it to the top 64 at all, and North Carolina also lost out in the first round of the championship.

In addition, it is also recently that Terence Clark, a 19-year-old new star from the University of Kentucky, died of speeding. Originally, this young man could have a good prospect in this year's draft conference, but after a tragedy, there are only infinite sadness and regret left to the world. In this event, the effectiveness of universities in shaping talents has inevitably been questioned.

In recent years, NCAA has been criticized most for its empty talk, no salary, and insufficient guarantee of life and health for the players while working hard for their alma mater.

Now has become the NBA all star Ben - Simmons once criticized, "NCAA is really rotten, play a year to leave the rules are rotten, everyone is making money, except the players.". But we are the people who get up early every day and train hard, and they (the top of NCAA) don't let us get any reward from it. They say it's education, but playing here for a year doesn't let me learn anything.

It is also because of the weakness of NCAA that NBA has been planning for a long time. Last year, it launched the development alliance training plan, which dug up the corner of famous universities in the most simple and crude way. At that time, the league's executive in charge of the project promised that these five-star high school students would complete the smooth transition (before entering the NBA) in a year's training competition, and that they would experience the training and competition rhythm similar to the NBA in advance. Of course, equally important, the Development League would also pay these children up to US $500000.

However, one year later, the talent training plan is not as smooth as expected. Looking at the latest draft forecast list, Jay green and Jonathan cumminga, the "test objects" of the development alliance, can still be ranked in the top five of the Lotto area. However, in the evaluation of many senior experts, they are not the suitable candidates for the top three. One year later, the experience in the development alliance has not brought enough attention to these children who are in urgent need of "traffic", and they have not made rapid progress as promised when they joined. On the contrary, it is the players who work hard in the University, some of whom are later.

In the past crazy three years, many young people are waiting for the chance to become famous overnight.

For example, jaren saggs of gonzagha university even won the praise of LeBron James for his magical three-point victory in the semi-final. Now, saggs is the top star of the 21st class. His every move on the court and even his love life are being followed by all media. On the draft list, he successfully entered the top three and became a hot spot of this year's flower exploration.

For another example, Gary Butler and Davian Mitchell, who led Baylor University to win the championship this year, were not well-known before crazy three. However, after leading the team to win the cup, Mitchell's predicted ranking has reached the top 10, and Butler has also entered the first round of the list.

Of course, there is also UCLA's Vietnamese star Johnny juzan. Because of his high-energy output of 22.8 points and 4 rebounds per game during the crazy three period, he has been firmly in the lottery area of many draft websites, and his popularity and his draft prospects continue to rise as the summer approaches.

Time goes on. In the past six or seven years, many people were selected by NBA and got professional contracts by making a name in the championship and "salted fish turn over". For example, mop shabaz Napier in 2014, Tyrus Jones in 2015, asidiakono in 16, di Vincenzo in 18 and Kyle guy in 19 all played well in the last three or four or final, and then made a counter attack in the draft.
