April 28, 2020-21 NBA regular season continues, Golden State Warriors at home against Dallas lone ranger. At the end of the game, the warriors lost 103-133 to the lone ranger, ending with two consecutive wins.

On the warriors' side, curry only played three quarters, got 27 points, 2 assists and 2 breaks, but his efforts alone could not stop the warriors from losing miserably.

Against Kenny Dalglish, curry scored 37 points and scored seven three-point goals. Unconsciously, his three-point total in April was close to 100 super miracles.

But Ku Li, who is big and attractive, is still being watched by his opponent after all. This game with the lone ranger, whether curry himself, or the Warriors team, have encountered great trouble.

In fact, at the beginning of the game, curry didn't realize the danger. With the help of his teammates, he still used conventional means to attack the opponent's defense. During this period, he was able to score three points and free throws. In less than four minutes, he has easily scored eight points.

But after getting these 8 points, curry's good days are over. In the next game, the lone ranger took an almost suffocating defensive strategy against him. As long as curry crossed the middle line, there would always be two people entwined in front of him. Curry had difficulty in shooting, so he could only pass the ball to his teammates helplessly. On this night, the other warriors felt cold and played fancy iron.

So, in the first section of 12-11 lead successively, warriors appeared as long as 8 minutes of "death" power, lone ranger is not soft, under the leadership of Dong Qiqi set off a wave of 25-0 attack frenzy. The lone ranger has a 20-0 record in the first quarter of the season, according to data.

But this field ball, the single section plays, the warrior 12-36 already full has fallen behind 24 points, the victory suspense even in a section plays under the situation has been killed.

Originally, on those winning nights, curry was the happiest factor on the field. He would run all over the field, jump, and cheer his teammates with all kinds of fancy celebrations. However, this night, the beginning of a short period of collapse, it is clear that the library did not interest. After that, he even squatted in the bottom corner for several consecutive rounds, without the slightest chance and willingness to catch the ball.

On and off the court, the warriors' players and coaches are quiet and frightening. It seems that the familiar taste of those tragic defeat nights at the beginning of the season has returned.

At half-time, the warriors only got 29 points, the lowest since Cole took charge of the warriors.

In the third quarter, curry's condition improved a little. He recovered some feeling and scored 15 points in a single quarter. However, this output not only made Curry's score come to 25 + again, but also helped him compete for the scoring champion of the season, but also did not change the general situation of the game.
