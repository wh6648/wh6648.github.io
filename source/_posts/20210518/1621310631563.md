After many twists and turns, the 2020-21 NBA regular season ended yesterday.

In the past quarter, due to the continued suspension of COVID-19, the schedule of the regular season has still shrunk, the audience is still very few, and the epidemic prevention regulations are still strict.

Although the schedule has shrunk, the match arrangement is very close. 30 teams are experiencing a high-intensity confrontation with the ball every other day. Under such high pressure, naturally many stars are in trouble with injuries.

In the west, from the defending champion Los Angeles to the clippers, Nuggets, jazz and other teams, they are all affected by the injury of stars, and even the reimbursement of serious injuries. Especially the Los Angeles team, due to the long-term injury of James and thick eyebrow, is forced to play a playoff. In the East, the 76ers, the nets, the heat and other teams are also hard to escape the disease, the strongest team nets is after Durant, Owen, harden has been injured, Aldrich joined and lightning retired and other changes, until the end of the regular season two games, finally put together a full set of first serve lineup.

In addition to injuries, strict epidemic prevention measures have also screened out many players who are infected with NCV or who are in close contact with NCV patients. Under the so-called health full agreement heavy penalty, many players feel the bad feeling of suddenly entering the truce list, and some games are forced to delay again and again. These variables have brought great uncertainty to the promotion of the season.

This kind of uncertainty also affects the ranking pattern of the East and the west to a certain extent. Some teams with good health take the opportunity to jump up. For example, the top two teams in the west this season are dominated by the two relatively despised teams, jazz and Suns; In the East, the Knicks and Hawks have become new forces. They have rushed into the top five, which has changed to some extent the inherent ecology established in the past few years.

Of course, a few families are happy and a few families are worried. After losing James Harden, the Rockets are completely reduced to the fish belly army of the alliance. They declared that they were rotten early and locked in the vice squad leader of the alliance early. In the future, how to draw a favorite draft signing has become the only concern of the rest of the city.

The warriors who won three titles in the previous five years also failed to perform the return of the king. Throughout the regular season, Jinzhou team went stumbling, until the end of the regular season, just barely grab a ticket for the playoff.

Of course, when it comes to warriors, you have to mention curry. Without the epic performance of 33 year old mengshen, the warriors will fall into the Lotto area again. But this season, curry showed a more magical personal state than the full vote MVP season. He averaged 32 points per game, won the League scoring champion, and wrote a number of historical records, showing the obstinacy of the post-80s superstars still firmly in hand.

Also writing legends are Wei Shao, Paul, Anthony and James, all of whom are surpassing the limits of their predecessors. This season, weishao surpassed Big O and became the three double kings of history; Paul led the Suns back to the playoffs, he also hit the top 5 assists in history; Melon, on the other hand, came to the top 10 in the history score list; As for James, he averaged 25 points per game for 17 consecutive seasons and is still writing his own milestone.

However, the post-90s still continue to seize the power. After the letter brother won the MVP in the regular season in the past two years, this season, the leading position in the MVP list was occupied by the same Mesozoic jockey. You know, the last time an orthodox and heavyweight center got the MVP, it has to be traced back to the distant 1999-2000 season, when O'Neal was still the "big shark" ruling the league. Time has changed, purebred center's life in the NBA has long been difficult, but this time, about the teacher's lead has delivered a strong signal against the current "small ball" trend.
