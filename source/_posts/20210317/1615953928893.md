On March 17, 2021, the U.S. media released some data of this season's basketball center Nicholas Clarkston.

According to statistics, Clarkston can get 8.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 1.5 blocks in 15.9 minutes this season. In 127 minutes of his presence, the positive and negative values were as high as + 49. In addition, his offensive efficiency is 124.3 (first in the League), defensive efficiency is 104.9 (31st in the League), net efficiency + 19.4 (third in the League).

In his eight games, the nets are 7-1.

At the beginning of the season, the inside line and defense of the net are the most questioned links. But recently manager Nash used Clarkston, everything seems to be solved. Clarkston has excellent athletic ability, defensive enthusiasm and sense of defense are extremely excellent, very effective supplement to the weakest link of the net. Offensive end almost does not occupy the right of the ball, he has a very good ability to eat cake, whether harden or Owen give him "cake", he can complete the end very well, adaptability is very strong.
