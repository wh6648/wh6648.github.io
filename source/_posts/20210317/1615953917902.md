On March 17, Sports Illustrated reporter Chris Mannix wrote an article today to analyze which players in the League may leave before the trade deadline, including LaMarcus Aldrich, Kyle lorry, Victor oradibo and others.



Although Lori himself and his agent have publicly come forward to refute rumors, it is foreseeable that Lori's days in the Raptors seem to be over. Lori's contract with Raptors expires in the summer and his salary is $30.5 million this season. Today's Raptors are starting to rebuild their teams around van fritt and shaikam, but Lori is still popular with other teams in the league. His performance this season is very stable, but his salary (US $30.5 million) makes the deal tricky. Executives from several rival teams have linked Lori to the Clippers (who are looking for a point guard) and the 76ers (Lori's home team). However, it's very difficult to find a deal, and the Raptors are still competing for a playoff seat, and Lori is unlikely to be bought out after the trade deadline.

The Houston Rockets are in free fall and haven't won a single game since early February - 16 consecutive losses. It's worth mentioning that Christian wood is absent from all 16 games. PJ Tucker has reached an agreement with the Rockets not to play for the team, and rival executives believe that the Miami Heat will become Tucker's favorite team. Victor oradibo rejected a two-year $4500a contract extension offered by the Rockets last month. Although this does not necessarily mean that oradibo wants to leave, the Rockets may not lose him in the off-season next year, and the heat will become a potential suitor of oradibo again.

It is worth mentioning that the provisional manager of the Hawks, McMillan, talked about oradipo in an interview today: "I know what he has done to get his body back to the level close to that before the injury. I know he is working hard, but it takes time."

Last summer, the thunder signed Horford in the off-season, the contract will expire in 2023, this season's salary is $27.5 million, the last year is $26.5 million (including 14.5 million guaranteed). Hofford was back on track in Oklahoma City, hitting 37.6% of the three-point field and becoming a stable presence in the dressing room. The thunder is willing to listen to other teams' offers for hofford, but they are also satisfied with the match between the veteran and Alexander (SGA). Moreover, the thunder's salary is very low (space is enough) and there is no need to deal with hofford's contract. Obviously, the thunder does not intend to send off Horford, but it is expected to break up with Trevor Ariza, a veteran who won the off-season trade last year, who has not played since March last year.
