On March 17, ESPN reporter Ramona Shelbourne reported that the Golden State Warriors had a disagreement on the use of James Wiseman, the top scorer of the new division, and the management was a little nervous when trying to balance their current situation.

Warriors this season has reached 50% of the winning rate, ranked ninth in the West. Team star Stephen Curry's performance is amazing enough, Kelly ubre has got rid of some problems at the beginning of the season, Andrew Wiggins has become an excellent player of the team. However, so far, James Wiseman has been in an unstable state in his rookie season. Warriors management seems to be at a crossroads - how to deal with Wiseman's appearance time.

ESPN reporter Ramona Shelbourne reports that there is a disagreement within the Warriors over the use of Wiseman. Some people want Wiseman to increase his playing time for the rest of the season so that he can grow up in his mistakes and improve himself at the same time. But the rest of the warriors' management want to make the best choice for the team and they want to win this season.

In addition, Ramona Shelbourne also said that the warriors have been trying to imitate the way the San Antonio Spurs build their team and cultivate young players. The warriors think Wiseman will become the all star of the future and the pillar of the team. This has become a sensitive issue to some extent as the team is considering how to deal with this situation for the rest of the season.

It is worth mentioning that Wiseman missed the training of the team due to missing the new crown test, which made head coach Cole very dissatisfied. In the next game with the clippers, Cole let Wiseman sit on the bench for three sections. In addition, Stephen curry also hopes Wiseman can learn from this incident. So far this season, Wiseman's average playing time is only 20.8 minutes, with 11.8 points and 6.0 rebounds.
