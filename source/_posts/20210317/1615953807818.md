On March 17, the NBA regular season continued, with the Rockets meeting the hawks at home. In the absence of wall and wood, oladibo made 13 of 20 shots, scored 34 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists, but his good performance did not help the Rockets end the losing streak. In the end, the rocket lost 107-119 to the Hawks.

In the first quarter, oradibo didn't enter the state directly. He hit the basket twice in a row and failed to return. He only scored 2 points with a middle distance throw.

But in the second quarter, oradipo broke out. First, he made a three-point retreat from the defense, and then he took cover to make another three-point shot. When the Rockets were unable to score, oradibo chose to attack the penalty area, hit hard and cause additional penalty. Then he grabbed the rebound and directly pushed the counterattack to break through the pull bar layup, and then broke through again to hit 2 + 1. In the second quarter of the game, oradibo scored 21 points in 7-for-8 shots. Together with Kevin Porter, he helped the Rockets maintain the score.

With Yi Bian fighting again, the Hawks obviously strengthened their defense against oradibo, while Audi did not continue to make a strong attack. Instead, they made more use of containment to create opportunities for their teammates. First, they assisted Tate to hit three points, then connected Martin to finish the dunk, and made another four assists in a single quarter. At the end of the third quarter, oradipo showed the value of a star player. First, he made a breakthrough in the middle, then hit the middle distance, and at the last moment, he scored the final attack with a single 1v1 three-point shot, which helped the Rockets narrow the difference to one point.
