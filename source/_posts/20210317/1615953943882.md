March 17 news, reports from the U.S. media said that the lone ranger team owner Mark Cuban reiterated in an interview that the team will not trade away christaps polzingis.

"We are not ready to trade portzingis," Kuban said. So listen carefully, this is absolutely impossible! "

This is the second time in a month that Cuban has publicly denied rumors about the Poseidon deal. In late February, it was reported that the lone Rangers were assessing the value of Poseidon's trade.

Sources said the lone Rangers had contacted the warriors to ask them about their interest in trading for Poseidon. Kuban's response at that time was, "we didn't put him (Poseidon) into any trading discussion, which didn't happen."

In the off-season of 2019, the lone Rangers and polzingis signed a five-year top salary contract with a total value of US $158 million, in which the fifth year is the player option. Now, Poseidon is in the second year of the contract.

In recent years, Poseidon has been trapped and injured, which has a certain impact on his own state. So far this season, polzingis, 25, has only played 23 games, averaging 30.3 minutes, with 20.8 points, 8.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.5 blocks.
