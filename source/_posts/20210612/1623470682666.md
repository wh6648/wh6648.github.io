After being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers will definitely adjust their lineup in this off-season period in order to attack the championship again. According to Evan Massey, an NBA agent said the Lakers may consider trading Kyle Kuzma in the off-season to bring in better talent players to assist LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

"The Lakers are frustrated with Kuzma's erratic performance and plan to trade him this off-season," he said An NBA agent said, "obviously, general manager pelinka will not sell him at a low price. If he trades with other players and adds more talented players to LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers will do so. If Kuzma is put on the shelf in this off-season, it is expected that many teams will be interested in him

At the 2017 draft conference, Kuzma entered the NBA as the No.27 draft. He also showed us that he was one of the best Rookies of that term. Rookies could contribute 16.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game in the season, and were selected into the first lineup of NBA rookies. However, after the introduction of Anthony Davis in 2019, Kuzma lost his starting position and played less and less. In the 2019-20 season, his average playing time was 25 minutes, contributing 12.8 points; The average playing time this season is 28.7 minutes, contributing 12.9 points. The playoff performance is not satisfactory. This season, the playoff average is only 6.3 points and the shooting percentage is 29.2%.
