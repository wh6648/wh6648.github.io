The Los Angeles Clippers announced today that their forward Sergi Ibaka had successfully undergone back surgery yesterday and will miss the rest of the playoffs this season.

Ibaka missed 30 regular season games in a row due to a back injury and returned in the last two games of the season. Ibaka played in the first two games of the Clippers' first round series against Dallas Rangers, but then missed the next seven playoffs.

"Nothing makes me happier than helping my brothers on the court and winning the championship for the Clippers." Ibaka wrote on his personal social media instagram, "it's been a very difficult season and I've worked very hard to get back to the playoffs, but injuries sometimes get in my way and health is the most important thing. I thank everyone for their love and support and now I have the support of the team to prepare for next season

Ibaka only played 41 games this season due to injury, averaging 11.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 23.3 minutes. 23.3 minutes is his lowest average playing time in the regular season since his first year in Oklahoma City in 2009-10 season.
