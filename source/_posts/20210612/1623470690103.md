On June 12, James Harden didn't flinch. The Brooklyn nets superstar didn't keep quiet about reports that he spent $100000 in cash to get a date with rapper saweetie. Harden chose to come forward to respond to this question, and issued a severe criticism to those who fabricated rumors.

Harden today updated instagram, his personal social media, calling it fake news, and said he was "tired" of all those who spread such rumors just for the sake of influence.

"I'm tired of people making up false stories, because I really don't talk nonsense. Don't involve me in all this rubbish. It's a pile of s-shit and rubbish. Let me go back to my real life. This is what those people make up to show off, which can't get in my way. 100000 dollars in cash? Pull it down. " Harden wrote in the social media.

Harden is unlikely to pay attention to these reports, he also made it clear that he would stay away from these problems, which is what the nets want. Due to hamstring injury, harden is currently in a truce state, has not yet played with the Bucks series. In short, harden has no time to listen to savitti's rumors. In addition, savitti himself did not comment on the matter.
