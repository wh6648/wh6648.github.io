On June 12, Utah Jazz star Donovan Mitchell's outstanding performance in the playoffs raised himself to a new height and became one of the most important stories of the playoffs. NBA Magic Johnson today tweeted praise to Mitchell, saying he is a real superstar. Stephen A. Smith, a famous football critic, thinks that Mitchell is the best player in jazz history.

"Donovan Mitchell is a real superstar. He scored 45 points in G1 and 37 points in G2 in the second round of the playoffs! When we discuss superstars in the future, we should mention more about Mitchell's name besides Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Stephen curry Magic Johnson wrote.

Stephen A. Smith, a well-known football critic, praised Donovan Mitchell. A. Smith said that Mitchell had done enough. The Jazz won the best record in the league this season under the leadership of him and Gerber, and Mitchell's performance in the playoffs made him the first man in jazz history. He can match Dwyane Wade and surpass Karl Malone and John Stockton.

"Donovan Mitchell is the 2.0 version of Dwyane Wade. He is a superstar. He beat Coway Leonard and Paul George, not one or the other. He beat Leonard and George. You know, this guy is only 24 years old. Mitchell has a strong body, can finish under the basket, can create scoring opportunities, can make fouls, has the ability to control the ball, there is nothing this brother can't do A-smith said on get up¡° In Utah, I don't want to hear about Karl Malone, and I don't want to hear about John Stockton. He's the best player in jazz history. I just said, "I don't stutter."

A - Smith also believes that the Jazz will successfully break through from the West into the finals, if the nets can not go all out, then the Jazz will beat Kevin Durant, James Harden and Carey Owen.

Mitchell did do well in the playoffs, averaging 32.7 points, 3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the past six games, shooting 48.2% and 3-point shooting 41.9%. However, a - Smith's opinion that Mitchell is the best player in jazz history has caused a lot of controversy. According to the media, Malone and Stockton led the jazz to the finals twice. Donovan hasn't made it to the Western Conference finals yet. Although he seems to be very close, a-smith's statement goes too far.
