On June 12, the NBA playoffs continued. The 76ers beat the Hawks 127-111, leading 2-1 in the series.

This game, Simmons 11 shot 7, won 18 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, to help the 76ers win.

Simmons' performance in this round of series is not excellent. In the game, he handed over the inefficient report card of 4 points, 3 rebounds and 7 assists. At the last moment, facing the opponent's "chopping tactics", it is not surprising that he missed two penalties, which led rivers to replace him. Although shooting has never been his specialty, he still needs to adjust his state in time to provide more support for nbid.

As soon as the first quarter came up, Simmons's desire to attack was still not high. He only shot twice to hit a goal, and only sent one assist. He was almost invisible at the offensive end. However, as a strong competitor for the best defensive player, Simmons shoulders the task of defending Trey young on the field. He gives the opponent enough defensive pressure to help the team gain an advantage from the defensive end.

In the second quarter, Simmons still didn't do much in the offensive end, which also has a lot to do with the Hawks' defense efforts not to let it push up the conversion. Fortunately, he was able to compress the defense through his height and physical advantages, creating opportunities for his teammates and sending out three assists.

After Yi Bian fought again, Simmons finally found a feeling in the offensive end. He used enbid's high position to coordinate. Simmons asked for the ball in the interior line to play high and low positions. Then he used the air slicing ball to assist Xiao KULI's bottom corner to hit three points. Then he finally pushed up the 76 people's favorite defensive counterattack and made a series of smashes. Then he continued to connect with enbid to complete the air relay, completely suppressing the opponent in momentum. The 76ers even once pulled the difference to 20 points, basically laying the foundation for victory.
