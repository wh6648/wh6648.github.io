This season's playoffs have been half of the battle, many stars have proved their value on this high standard stage, but some people have gradually lost their value and become negative assets of the team.

For example, the following:

1. Paul George

Since the playoffs this year, George has averaged 23.1 points, 9.1 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game. It seems that these three figures are higher than those of last season. But unfortunately, George is often invisible when the team needs him most, and his poor hit rate and weak actual combat output have also become the main reasons for the difficult journey of the Clippers.

Since joining the clippers, George no longer has the fighting power of the former top forward. If last year, his poor performance can be attributed to his shoulder injury, the team that the Clippers don't yet have a tacit understanding with, and the use of troops by coach rivers, then this season, when the original plot is copied, George has no excuse.

2. CJ mccullam

This season, the Blazers suffered a round of playoffs tour, and the star Damian Lillard burst to play in sharp contrast, the second leader CJ mccullham is in a very bad state. In six games, he only got 20.7 points per game, which is a new personal low in the past six years. His three-point shooting rate is only 33.3%, and he repeatedly missed the chance of key ball. No wonder, after the end of the season, it is reported that CJ has become a negative asset in the trading market, and his prospects this summer are also complicated and gloomy because of the poor play in the playoffs.

3. Andre Drummond

In the middle of this season, the Lakers have made great efforts to recruit "Zhuang Shen" Drummond. Although, for Zhuang Shen, the coaching team has given full trust, but also has been ensuring his starting position, playing time. However, Zhuang Shen's performance is extremely disappointing. From the later part of the regular season to the playoffs, he has been wandering outside the system. His offensive means are single, and his defense has also been targeted. Gradually, his ability has been questioned by his teammates.

In the playoffs, Zhuang Shen averaged only 9 points and 11 rebounds per game. His performance was extremely bad, and he was eventually abandoned by the coach team of the Lakers in the key G6. Also from that moment, Zhuang Shen's breakup with the Lakers entered the countdown, but in the off-season, even if he left the purple gold army, his employment prospects may not be too ideal.

4. Dennis Schroeder

Of course, Chuang Shen is not the only player who lost his value in the playoffs of the Lakers. In the backcourt, Dennis Schroeder's performance is also disappointing. You know, Schroeder was one of the best sixth man players in the League last season. This season, in James, thick eyebrow brother has been injured, he once shouldered the team attack.

However, in this year's playoffs, Schroeder's average score per game dropped to 14.3 points, with a 3-point shooting rate of only 30.8%, and he once had a poor performance of 0 point in a single game. In the middle of the season, the Lakers offered Schroeder a four-year $80 million contract extension, but he refused. Now, it's very difficult for him to fight for a similar contract.

5. Kenba Walker

Up to now, kenba Walker has been the leading star of the team for most of his career. After he joined the green shirt two years ago, he was also highly expected by the fans, and was regarded as providing stable firepower support and experience guidance for the young shuangtanhua.
