On June 12, the NBA playoffs continued. In the Eastern Conference semi-final, the eagles and the 76ers moved to Atlanta for the third game of the series. In the end, the 76ers were 127-111, leading the eagles 2-1.

The 76ers' defense strategy is very clear at the beginning of the game. The high-intensity attack on the ball holder, especially on Trey Yang, will not only help prevent the attack, but also surround many people, forcing them to give the ball. At the same time, they speed up the rotation defense and cut off the pass route. After the Hawks' outside line burst into the basket, the 76ers' defense height quickly shrinks relying on the inside line. This defensive strategy completely disrupted the rhythm of the eagles' attack. The efficiency of the eagles' attack was extremely low at the beginning stage. In the first quarter, the eagles only relied on Bogdanovic's personal strong attack to maintain the difficult situation. The whole team only had two assists in the first quarter, but sent out six mistakes at the same time.

After gradually replacing the substitute lineup, although the personal ability of forward lines such as Dewey and Gallinari can help the Hawks to chase points, their internal lines are very weak. Not only Howard can attack in succession in the internal line, but also the external line is strong enough to burst into the basket and lack protection, and the rebounds are also lost one after another. Capella grabbed seven rebounds in the first quarter, while the rest of the team grabbed nine in the first half. On the contrary, the 76ers had a deeper substitute lineup and better performance. The substitute scored 30 points in the first half. The score of the substitute lineup of the two teams was 43 points from the 76ers of the eagle 30 team.

In the second half, the 76ers re deployed their defense against Trey Yang. Just like in the beginning of the first quarter, they continued to attack and encircle him. Not only Trey Yang himself fell into the doldrums again, but also the Hawks' attack was cut off again, By the 76ers, 19-6 down to 18.

At the same time, the attack system of the 76ers is obviously more three-dimensional and rich. In this game, although the Hawks are crazy to step up enbid, he can not only create damage, but also create opportunities for his teammates. At the same time, Simmons and Harris can also attract defense in the low position and create opportunities for the outside line. The 76ers rely on the combination of internal and external play, which is always very efficient in the offensive end, The whole game did not appear to attack the power-off situation, always firmly maintain the lead, and finally won the big win.
