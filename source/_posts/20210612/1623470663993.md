On June 12, the NBA playoffs continued. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the hawks and the 76ers, who had drawn 1-1 in the first two games, moved to Atlanta for the third game of the series. In the end, the Hawks lost 111-127 to the 76ers, and the 76ers took the lead 2-1. In this game, Trey young encountered tight defense, shot 9 of 17, scored 3 of 6, scored 28 points, 8 assists and 2 steals.

In the first two games of the series, Trey Yang sent two doubles, especially in the first game won by the eagles, Trey Yang scored 35 points and 10 assists. In the first two games, the 76ers not only did not limit Trey Yang's personal attack, but also let him connect with the whole team. To this game, the 76ers obviously made more adequate preparation. From the beginning of the game, they chased and intercepted Trey Yang, which would not only trap him, but also attract him to fall into three people's encirclement, forcing him to pass the ball and cut off the contact with his teammates.

In the first quarter of the game, Trey Yang not only had few mobile phones, but also had difficulty connecting his teammates. In a single quarter, Trey Yang had only one breakthrough throw and one three-point hit, got five points in 2 of 4 shots, only sent out one assist, but made two mistakes. However, in the second quarter, with the game going on, the defensive strength of the 76ers also decreased, and the situation of Trey young also improved.

In the second quarter, when he fell behind to 11 points, Trey young first broke through to the basket, then assisted Collins in the counterattack with a long-distance pass, and then assisted Bogdanovic to make a three-point dash. He also made a sudden stop and hit in the middle shot. He broke through the middle and high throw again, and assisted Collins in the air to receive the slam dunk. During this period, he also made three kills, and made six free throws in total, At the end of the half-time, he made a quick attack from the back to the front.

In the second half of the 24 points, Trey Yang got 10 points and 3 assists, and directly participated in 17 of them. Although he did not help the Hawks catch up with the score, it was his recovery that helped the Hawks get out of the downturn at the beginning, forming a deadlock with the 76ers, and did not further open the score. However, after the midfield adjustment, the 76ers re deployed their defense against Trey Yang in the second half, just like the first quarter, with both pinch, CO defense and containment, Trey Yang fell into a difficult situation again.

The third quarter, Trey - Yang only 4 for 1, the Hawks attack also cut off power again, was played a wave of 76 people, 19-6 behind to 18 points. The general situation of the game has gone. When he was 20 points behind in the last quarter, Trey Yang finally hit three points again. Obviously, the second three points of this game came too late. The team always fell behind by two figures. Trey Yang also complained about a technical foul when he was refereed.

In the garbage time stage, Trey Young made a breakthrough and a super long three points in succession, but it did not hinder the overall situation. In this game, Trey Yang was still able to score 28 points and 8 assists under strict defense. Obviously, he has tried his best to help the team, but the team's overall strength is far away, so it is reasonable to lose this game.
