June 19, 2020-21 NBA playoffs continue, the Atlanta Hawks at home against the Philadelphia 76ers. In the end, the 76ers beat the Hawks 104-99, rewriting the series total score to 3-3.

According to the plan, the two teams will fight for seven in the early morning of the 21st. Looking at the previous six games of the two teams, the strength of the two teams is quite close. I'm afraid that in the Seventh World War, it's difficult for the two teams to win or lose directly.

In terms of the strength of the team, the 76ers are obviously more powerful, and the internal and external lines are more balanced, especially the point of nbid. In the past six games, nbid almost completely suppressed Capella and directly dominated the Hawks' restricted area. In addition, Harris can also give enbid some support in the game. In the interior, the 76ers obviously have the upper hand.

In the field, the eagles with Trey Yang are better. Trey Yang has played a great role in the past six games, especially the three points of the outside line and the direct attack of the basket and the ball with the help of pick and roll breakthrough have become the eagles' most powerful weapon to kill the 76ers. In the Seventh World War, I'm afraid the 76ers still can't completely limit Trey Yang's play.

It is worth mentioning that although the 76ers team with Simmons has great strength on the outside, Simmons' performance in the past few games has become a short board of the team. It is difficult to make a stable score contribution on the offensive end and fall into foul traps on the defensive end. In addition, the short board of inaccurate free throws has become the target of the eagles' direct attack. In the past few games, the eagles often used the "shark chopping tactics" to recover points, and Simmons also repeatedly lost two free throws. Even in the fifth game of the two teams, Simmons lost 10 free throws, which also became one of the important reasons for the team's loss.
