On June 18, the thunder officially announced a deal with Celtic. The specific contents are: the green army sent out kenba walker, the 16th signing in the first round of this year, a second round signing in 2025, Al hofford, Moses brown and a second round signing in 2023 from the thunder.

It is worth mentioning that this is the first deal made by Brad Stevens, President of green army basketball operations, since he took office. At the beginning of this month, Denny Angie announced his retirement, and Stevens transformed into management after leaving the green army.

The reason why the green army sent Walker away was due to his disappointing performance this season. Because of his left knee injury, Walker missed the last two games of the green army this year, which also led to the green army's 1-4 elimination by the nets in the first round of the playoffs.

Walker revealed in an interview that he needs to focus on health issues. Walker has been dealing with his left knee for most of 2020, which has resulted in his absence from the start of the 20-21 regular season. Throughout the regular season, walker had 29 injuries.

In the regular season, Walker averaged 31.8 minutes, 19.3 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.1 steals.

As a four time all star, Walker has two years left on his current contract, more than $73 million. "The deal gives the green army the financial flexibility to get rid of Walker's remaining contracts," Warsaw wrote on social media. Thunder team can treat Chris - Paul, Cameron - Anthony and hofford as, for walker to make the next step plan

Hofford is back in Boston. He played in the green army in 2016-19 and was an all star in 2018. Because of health problems, hofford didn't play in the last 28 Games of the regular season.

Hofford, 35, has two years left with $53.5 million, of which the 22-23 season is only partially guaranteed, with $14.5 million guaranteed.

It was Brown's second year in the NBA, averaging 8.6 points and 8.9 rebounds per game. In March, brown signed a multi-year contract with the thunder.
