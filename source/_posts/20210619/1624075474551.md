According to reports from NBA reporter Tim McMahon on June 19, the Rockets are not expected to implement avery Bradley's team option, according to informed sources.

Last year, during the off-season, Bradley and the heat signed a two-year contract worth $11.6 million, with the second year as the team option.

As a defense expert, Bradley played for the Lakers last season, helping the Zijin team get the first place in the West. Unfortunately, Bradley missed the second round in Orlando for personal reasons, and the Lakers won the NBA championship in 2020.

Bradley's salary next season is $5.92 million a year. Once the Rockets refuse to implement the team option, it means Bradley will test the free market this summer.

On the closing day of this year's trade, the Rockets won Bradley from the heat in a deal involving Victor oradibo.

After Bradley came to Houston, he played 17 regular season games for the Rockets, averaging 5.2 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists.

Bradley is still a good winger, he can provide the team with projection and defense. But the problem is that Bradley's competitive state has declined more in the past two years.
