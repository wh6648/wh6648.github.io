On June 20, ESPN reporter Tim McMahon revealed in a podcast that he was informed that the two leading stars of the lone ranger team, Luca doncic and christaps polzingis, did not like each other.

"The lone Rangers have a long history of chaos, because team owner Mark Cuban will be involved in all basketball related decisions," McMahon said. "As far as I know, polzingis doesn't like playing for the lone Rangers at all, but he won't apply to the team for a deal."

"If the lone Rangers trade portzingies this summer, he won't be heartbroken," McMahon continued. "Obviously, for the lone Rangers, the most important thing in the off-season is to deal with portzingies."

"The team has two options to make polzingis the second star of the lone ranger team; Or trade portzingis for the second star, "McMahon said." but at the moment, it's hard to see either. "

McMahon also talked about the relationship between donchich and polzingis¡° Now their relationship is a bit awkward because they don't like each other, which makes things more complicated. "

This week, great changes took place within the lone ranger team, with former basketball operation president Donnie Nelson and former coach Rick Carlisle resigning one after another. Today, the lone ranger official, xuandeke Nowitzki, returned to the team as a special advisor.
