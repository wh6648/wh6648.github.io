June 20 news, reports from the U.S. media said that today's Nets coach Steve Nash in an interview, openly talked about Janice adtokumbo's free throw problem.

Now this problem has been put on the table, that is the letter brother in the free throw preparation time is too long. According to the regulations, one free throw should be completed within 10 seconds; But the preparation time for each free throw is more than 10 seconds

In the first two games of the eastern semi-finals, the Buckley center, the home court of the nets, used the big screen on the spot to count down the free throw of Letterman. And in the first round of the playoffs, the heat home is the same way.

It is worth mentioning that the League does not agree that the home team encourages fans to satirize each other's players in this way, and has informed the nets to stop counting down the letter brother's free throw on the big screen at the center of Barclays.

Today, when it comes to letterman's free throw, Nash expressed his opinion that "the league's free throw of 10 seconds violates the rules, and it is not implemented here in Younis!"

G6 when the letter gene free throw preparation time is too long, the nets star James Harden has no choice but to show his hand and complain to the referee.
