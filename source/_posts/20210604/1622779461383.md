On June 4, it was reported that the playoff battle between the Lakers and the Suns was in progress. There were still 6 minutes and 35 seconds left in the first quarter of the game. Anthony Davis, who just came back, was not fit and applied to quit the game on the bench. Now he has returned to the bench. According to Chris Haynes, a well-known journalist, Davis is now back in doubt.

Davis suffered a groin injury in the fourth game of the Suns playoff series, and he missed the fifth game of the series. Without Davis, the inside defense of the Lakers suffered a huge blow, so did the team's attack, and finally lost to the Suns 85-115. After losing the game, the defending champion series was 2-3 behind, and the situation was in danger.

Already standing on the edge of the cliff, the Lakers ushered in Davis' comeback in the key G6 game. However, did not play to half a quarter, Davis could not hold back and returned to the dressing room. After 6:35 in the first quarter, Davis seemed to hurt his groin again when blocking Devon Booker's breakthrough layup. He stopped in the back court, sat on the edge of the court to communicate with the team doctor, and then returned to the dressing room accompanied by the staff.

After a period of examination and treatment, Davis returned to the sidelines, but at this time his injured groin has been wrapped in an ice bag. So far, Davis's data is 0 points, 1 rebounds, 1 assists, no shots.
