On June 4, it was reported that the Los Angeles Lakers encountered a very disturbing event before the battle of life and death. Dennis Schroeder, the team's starting point guard, deleted the title of "Los Angeles Lakers point guard" when updating his personal instagram resume today. Now for some reason, he decided to add the profile back.

"It seems that Schroeder re edited his Ig resume under pressure. You forced him to send it back." Lakeshow yo wrote.

However, damage has been done. Schroeder's bizarre behavior on social media has sparked rumors that he is about to leave the Lakers. Schroeder was severely criticized for being beaten by the suns in Game 5. If you believe these rumors, it seems that Schroeder has taken these accusations to heart and decided to reconsider his future with the Lakers.

Schroeder has 15.5 million contract left with the Lakers this season, and he will become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season of this year. According to previous reports, Schroeder rejected a four-year, $84 million early contract extension from the Lakers in the middle of the season. In the regular season, Schroeder averaged 15.4 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game. In the first round of the playoffs, Schroeder's average per game dropped to 13.2 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.8 assists. Especially in the fifth game of the series, he made 0 of 9 shots and didn't get a point.
