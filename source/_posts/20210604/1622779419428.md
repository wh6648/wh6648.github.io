On June 4, the NBA playoffs continued. The Blazers lost 115-126 to nuggets, with a big score of 2-4.

This round of series, both sides in the defensive side have given a very targeted strategy, the pioneers from the beginning to the end did not pinch on Jokic, such a defensive strategy makes although Jokic can play efficient scoring performance, but can not drive his teammates.

The adjustment of nuggets is also very timely. Other players have more control over the ball, which makes Nuggets' integrity completely open. Little rivers and Mont Morris break out one after another. The excellent performance of role players makes Nuggets take the lead in the series.

On the Trail Blazers side, a group of interesting data is that in the game that Trail Blazers won, lilard averaged 22 points per game; In the game lost by the Blazers, lilard averaged 44.7 points per game. It's not difficult to find that when the Blazers lose, the scoring point is very single, CJ and Powell did not give lilard the support they should have, and their hesitation will directly lead to the stagnation of the Blazers' attack.

But this field comes up, CJ and Powell enhanced the offensive aggressiveness obviously, before the first half of the first quarter, lilard handed over the ball power more, this way also helped the Blazers to realize the multi-point flowering in the offensive end, the outside line three points hit continuously, made Nuggets' defense completely unable to find the key person.

On the Nuggets side, although little Porter made a phenomenal scoring performance, scoring 22 points in a single quarter and biting the score with his own strength, Jokic got into foul trouble in the first quarter, and the other role players didn't have Jokic to create opportunities for him, so the offensive efficiency was greatly reduced, so the Nuggets fell into a passive position.

With the progress of the game, little Porter was disturbed by more defense, and it became extremely difficult to make a shot. When little Porter's magic was not there, joachi could only chisel one-on-one. Although the efficiency was not low, he scored 20 points in a single quarter, but he could not hurt the pioneers. On the other hand, in terms of the pioneers, coventon and anfini Simmons made 6-for-6 three-point shots, which opened up the offensive space of the whole pioneers. CJ's one-to-one efficiency was also improved, and the initiative of the game was firmly in the hands of the pioneers.

But at the end of the third quarter, the game changed suddenly. Nurkic's four culprits became the absolute turning point of the game. Yokic was completely unstoppable in the inner line. The Blazers' three-point shooting rate began to drop, and the game completely returned to the same starting line.

At the end of the festival, the pioneers who relied on the shooting percentage suddenly cut off the power and failed to shoot in a row, while the Nuggets played steadily. Monte Morris continued his excellent personal performance in this round of series and shared a lot of pressure for Jokic. And at the last moment, lilard also failed to change his life, and eventually the pioneers had no choice but to stop in the first round.
