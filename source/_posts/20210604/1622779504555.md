June 4 news, according to previous reports, Boston Celtics basketball affairs president Denny Angie will step down, team coach Brad Stevens will replace Angie's position, into the team management. As president of the team's basketball business, Stevens will help the team start looking for a new manager. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Cole also talked about this matter in an interview today. Cole said that although he has a close relationship with Stevens, he did not get information in advance.

"I have a very close relationship with Brad. We'll be sending messages all season. I'm a big fan of him. " "I think he's a great coach," warriors coach Cole told Tim Kawakami on the TK show podcast. As you might expect, he didn't say a word to me. It's a big decision and you need to keep it a secret

"I'm really shocked to hear that, but sit down and think about it - his children are still in school, he's been suffering for the past few years, and life in Orlando's playoff park last year was very hard for everyone." Cole continued, "from my personal point of view, there's a reason why I wait until my children are adults to start coaching. I don't want to miss my family life, which is why I've been in the television industry for many years. I think it all shows the problem, this job (coaching the team) is really tired

Over the past few years, Cole has never been shy of praising Stevens and even joking that he learned some of Stevens's tactics. Cole said he would miss the past encounter with Stevens: "I'm really disappointed because I think he's an extraordinary coach who has influenced a lot of people in the league." Cole added.

According to statistics, Stevens has coached Celtic for eight seasons with a record of 354-282, with a victory rate of 55.7%. He has led the team to the playoffs seven times and the division finals three times.
