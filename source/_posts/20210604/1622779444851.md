On June 4, the series G6 between the Lakers and the Suns will be held at Staples Center today. Before the game, the coach of the Lakers, Vogel, gave an interview.

Vogel said in an interview that previously injured pop can play today, and the situation of thick eyebrow needs to be decided before the game. Previously, due to groin injury, eyebrow has been absent from the game between the Lakers and the suns. The Lakers defeated the suns in that game and are now 2-3 behind.

Talking about the physical condition of thick eyebrow, Vogel revealed: "at present, he is doing some stretching exercises, and then he will consult the doctor. He hopes to be able to play. But he needs the doctor's permission first. We don't want to do anything that is not wise to his body, which will lead to some long-term problems. He needs to be allowed to play by the doctor, even though he has a strong desire to play

In addition, according to shams, the Lakers will use Gasol junior to replace Zhuang Shen in the starting line-up.
