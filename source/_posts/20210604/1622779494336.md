As the first round of the playoffs draws to a close, in the East, the 76ers, the nets, and the Bucks, who are the hottest contenders for the title, have completed the clearance early. In the west, jazz, the top regular season player, also made it to the next round.

But it was unexpected that the two most powerful teams in the west, the Lakers and the clippers, were both pushed to the brink of elimination by 2-3 points in the series.

You know, at the beginning of this season, what was the scenery of the Los Angeles twins, and now, how embarrassed the two teams are, what happened to them, and what caused them to fall into such a situation, I'm afraid it's not clear in a few words

This season, due to James and thick eyebrow brother successively injured, the Laker's season journey is extremely difficult. At the end of the regular season, under the joint efforts of many teams, they were forced to fall to the seventh place in the West and were forced to play a play off. At that time, the suns in the second place became the first round opponent of the Lakers, which was quite helpless and helpless. For this strong opponent, the Suns did not seem to have much confidence to win.

Who would have thought that after five games in the series, the Lakers not only failed to take advantage of the Suns, but also were driven into a desperate situation by the Phoenix Youth army. Before the start of the playoffs, Zhan Mei went out with an injury, which was worrying. Now, the thick eyebrow elder brother encounters the groin new injury, the situation is more and more bad.

According to the previous exposure of medical experts, the injury of thick eyebrow is the result of compensation for its Achilles tendon injury. In other words, the Achilles tendon injury further increased the stress on other parts of his body, which led to his groin injury. Although the injury is only level one, he needs at least a week's rest time to fully recover. Obviously, the Lakers don't have a week to wait.

In the thick eyebrow brother injured, has always been good at adjusting the coach Vogel also disordered, he is still stubborn use of a large team. What's worse is that in the battle of Tianwang mountain, Warsaw's persistence led to a tragic defeat. The Lakers were weak in attack, and even their proud defense was broken to pieces. But when the purple gold army most needs the score time, the old James output and the fighting spirit also obviously was inferior to the previous season.

The Clippers are no better off. At the end of the regular season, they managed to avoid the Lakers. However, in the first round of the playoffs, facing the lone ranger for the second year in a row, the trend of the plot is quite different from that of last year. In the first two games of the series, the Clippers fought at home, but they were defeated by their opponents.

Although, after moving to Dallas, taking advantage of Dong Qiqi's neck injury, the Clippers pulled two games in a row, recovered a lot of points and also won back momentum. However, in the crucial battle of Tianwang mountain, when the lone ranger sacrificed his double towers and Dong Qiqi put out his epic fighting firepower, the Clippers lost again, which was perhaps the most important game of the whole season.

Now, whether it's the Lakers or the clippers, they all need to fight in the life and death battle of G6. No matter how touching the two teams' heroic words were and how brilliant their great prospects are, now they are forced to either win or go home to fish.

At this time, recalling the Lake boat's "Sao" operation at the end of the regular season, especially the Clippers' painstaking and shameless layout in order to avoid the Lakers, it seems more ironic and funny.

Of course, from another point of view, the Los Angeles twins can be reduced to this point, which precisely shows that after a year of training, the comprehensive strength of the lone ranger and the Suns has been continuously improved. Once the next, the Lakers and the clippers can not successfully extricate themselves, then the Western Championship pattern will also be fundamentally changed£¨ (Poirot)
