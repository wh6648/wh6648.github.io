According to reports from US media on June 4, the heat are ready to offer a four-year top salary contract with a total value of $181 million to Jimmy Butler, according to informed sources.

Prior to that, the Miami Herald was informed that Butler was seeking an early contract extension for the top salary during the off-season this year.

Will the heat give it to you? Now, Miami wants to keep Butler for a long time. So it's no surprise that the heat will offer a four-year top salary of $181 million early contract extension in the off-season this year.

In July 2019, Butler joined the heat by signing first and then changing. At that time, he signed a four-year top salary contract with a total value of $142 million.

Butler has two years left on his current contract, the last of which is a player option. According to the labor agreement, Butler has the right to extend his contract with the heat in advance during this off-season.

Once the two sides reach a top salary agreement, Butler's annual salary for the four years will be US $40.5 million (2022-23 season), US $43.8 million (23-24 season), US $47 million (24-25 season) and US $50.3 million (25-26 season).
