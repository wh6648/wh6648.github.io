On June 4, when the Blazers regretfully lost to the Nuggets and stopped in the semi-final of the Western Conference, lilard encountered the opponent's key defense. As a result, he made 8 of 20 shots and scored 28 points and 13 assists.

Lillard first steals kampazo in a defense at the beginning, then he assists CJ mcclelham to hit. Then Lillard broke through with the ball and made a beautiful European step to change the rhythm of the layup. Then Lillard resolutely attacked the inside line to make fouls, and hit another 3 points. Then Lillard made a layup and scored another 3 points. After the start, Lillard had already scored 12 points, and even tried to score a 3-point close to the middle line! Lillard's all-round firing also made Nuggets have to clamp him, and he just delivered a series of assists.

In the second quarter of the game, Lillard also took the lead in assisting mcclelham to score after he came back on the stage. Later, Lillard used pick and roll to cut into the layup to score. Then Lillard sent out three assists in a row and scored 5 points in the final stage, helping the Blazers to pull the difference to 7 points!

In the third quarter of the game, Lillard tried to open the situation with three big points, but failed. Later, Lillard still used Nuggets' blocking tactics to create open shot opportunities for his teammates. He sent out four assists in a row, two of which were 3 points from Wimbledon to help the Blazers take the initiative. But Lillard's offensive feel is still low. He failed to make a backward jump shot and missed another pass. Although he used the free throw to score positively, his poor feel also foreshadows the future process.
