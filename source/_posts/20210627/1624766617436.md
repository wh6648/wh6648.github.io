On June 27, recently, Lakers star Anthony Davis watched the game of the WNBA Los Angeles fireworks team. During the interview, he talked about the off-season status so far and the future plan.

After winning the 2020 championship, he can't do anything in the regular off-season, which is also reflected in this season.

He's been dealing with injuries most of the season, and when he manages to play, he looks sluggish. Although these two things can't define his ability as a player, the injuries he suffered basically led to a failed season. The groin injury eliminated him and the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs.

Now, he has a full off-season to get his body back to normal and try to regain the NBA championship with the Lakers in 2021-22.

"About three weeks to play? After G6, I didn't do anything, just training and recovering from groin injuries, and then playing games. I really didn't do anything. We can't do much now, but I enjoy spending time with my family, staying at home, playing games, relaxing with my family and accompanying my daughter. I have a son who will be born soon, so I'm looking forward to it. I just want to stay alive and prepare for next season Said thick eyebrow.

Nongmei said in an interview before that he usually doesn't do anything within a month after the end of the season. The current situation is fully in line with this, especially considering the injury he suffered before the end of the season. I hope that Nongmei can get back to health as soon as possible and put into training again for next season.

And, Nongmei also announced that he would welcome his son's birth, so he would spend some time with his family. NBA players will be away from their families for a lot of time, so it's also a good thing to be with their families in the coming important moments.
