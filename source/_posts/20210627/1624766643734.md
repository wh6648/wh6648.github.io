On June 27, the Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Atlanta Hawks in the Seventh World War and were eliminated. The team's guard Ben Simmons was criticized for his poor performance and no desire to attack. Although shooting has never been Ben Simmons' strong point, his high school coach doesn't think his shooting is a serious problem.

"I think it's more a mental problem than a physical one. I know that there are some things to clean up. Since high school, I think his projection is very good. He's a bit inclined to attack with his left hand, but it's very slight Kevin Boyle, Ben Simmons' high school coach, said on the "takeoff" podcast, "when he first arrived in Philadelphia, I didn't know what happened, but his posture changed - really, technically incorrect - I think maybe he was trying to straighten his arm, and his arm opened, and the result was not very good. I think he lost confidence."

"The outside world has been criticizing him (Ben Simmons), so you will not do something to prevent others from criticizing you. You will become a bit deliberate. I've seen him make 12 of 15, 11 of 16, 10 of 14 on the free throw line many times. This kind of data is very common in high school. Now he's starting to struggle, and he's going to make three out of ten. Obviously, it's a spiritual issue. I think it's something he can solve. If he's aggressive on the offensive side, he's one of the top 10 players in the NBA. There is no doubt that if he tries to attack, he can average 22 points and 23 points Kevin Boyle continued.

"I think he needs some fixed shots, he has to have a sense of responsibility, or if you don't do it, you have to have something else - just like a rebellious mentality. You don't care about the results, but we care about your shots and free throws. We want to have 10 free throws in a game, we want to have X goals in a game - this kind of psychology can be adjusted in the gym and some corrections, but there are also some technical problems, I think the important thing now is the psychological level, the confidence problem. Again, it's not always easy to solve, but it definitely can. " Kevin Boyle said.

In December 2019, Brett brown, the former 76ers coach, said that he hoped Ben Simmons would give eight free throws in each game. Although Simmons' free throw rate is rising every season, he has not reached the level expected by brown.

"I don't think there will be any result if you don't do what they ask for. For me, the result is that you either shoot or you can't start the next game. In my opinion, this is a kind of rebellious mentality: I believe you, and I am full of confidence in it. I know what you can do. We have to help you out, we need to do something. So, I hope Ben (Simmons) doesn't deal with this wrong way. We have to solve this problem, or you will be criticized for not doing it. You play a little hesitant, not confident in the offensive end, because you may not want to be criticized and talked about because you don't want to score. These are normal reactions, but if you don't, you may be criticized more for not daring to fight in the last quarter, or for not being aggressive enough and becoming a disadvantage in some situations at the critical moment. In any case, you will be criticized. You might as well be more aggressive. " Kevin Boyle said

Kevin Boyle believes that Ben Simmons can come out of the trough and become a better player. Kevin Boyle said: "I am very, very confident that he will become a star player. He will be an all star 10 times, a best team one or two three times and win the championship. I'm very confident about that. He's so talented
