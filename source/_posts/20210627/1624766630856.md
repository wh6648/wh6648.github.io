On June 27, according to the New York Daily, nets player Ding Weidi is eager to play in his hometown of Los Angeles.

This off-season should be an interesting season for the Lakers, because after their first round exit in the playoffs, there are obviously many loopholes in their lineup that need to be fixed.

Unfortunately, considering that the Lakers have at least 10 free agents who are likely to sign again and have exceeded the salary cap, they have only limited resources to improve their level. This makes it more difficult for the Lakers to bring in outside free players. In addition to the middle-level specialties, the Lakers can only sign before changing.

One of the possible options is nets guard Ding Weidi, who recently jumped out of the player option to test the free market. According to Mingji, he wants to play in Los Angeles.

"Ding is unlikely to return to the nets after accepting a three-year contract of $34 million, which is far below his market value. According to sources, the double guard wants to go home, or "get a good salary."

"Home is his preferred destination, but he also wants to ensure his financial future." Ding Weidi's hometown is Los Angeles and he has been recovering all season. If Ding Weidi wants to join the Lakers or the clippers, he must sign before changing.

Ding Weidi played 64 games for the nets in the 2019-20 season, averaging 20.6 points, 3.6 rebounds and 6.8 assists. Last season, he played only three games and suffered from anterior cruciate ligament tear. Ding Weidi was expected to come back in the NBA Finals, but the nets were eliminated. From this point of view, he has no problem coming back next season.

But for the Lakers, it may be difficult to get Ding Weidi, because it has to be a deal to sign before changing. The Lakers not only have to give up such valuable players as Kuzma or Pope, but also set hard restrictions on the free players they get by signing first and then exchanging, so other free players may be forced to sign with other teams.
