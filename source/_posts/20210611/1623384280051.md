On June 11, the League told teams today that they are inclined to return to the normal schedule next season, according to a report by the famous reporter of the Olympic.

According to the source, the time line for the 2021-22 NBA season has been determined. The training camp opened at the end of September and the regular season began on October 19 local time. The playoffs will start on April 16 local time. The 2022 finals are planned to be held on June 3 local time. If the finals reach G7, it will be June 19 (local time). On the other hand, the 2022 draft conference will be held on June 23 local time.

It is worth mentioning that the League issued a memorandum to the teams, and did not mention the end of the 21-22 season regular season. This means that the league has not yet decided whether it will continue to introduce playoffs next season.

Also, because it is not sure whether there will be a playoff, whether the regular season next season will be 82 games has not been determined.

Influenced by COVID-19, the NBA schedule has been greatly adjusted in recent two years. After the 2020 finals in the closed Park, 51 days later, the 20-21 season training camp opened. At the start of this season's regular season, it's only 72 days since the Lakers won their 17th championship.

The tight schedule did have a huge impact on all teams. The heat and the Lakers, two teams that made it to the finals in 2020, were both out in the first round of this year's playoffs. Of the eight teams that made it to the semi-finals of the East and west last season, only two teams made it to the second round in this year's playoffs.

There are still some unknowns, including whether the Raptors can return to Toronto in the 21-22 season? Struggling with the epidemic, the Raptors are scheduled to stay at home this season in Tampa, Florida.
