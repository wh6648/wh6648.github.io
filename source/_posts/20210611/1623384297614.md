On June 11, the NBA legend and famous basketball commentator Charles Barkley said in an interview with the New York Daily News that he was disgusted with the super team.

Kevin Durant, Carey Owen and James Harden assembled to build a super fleet, and now the nets are on their way to the Eastern Conference finals. But when Brooklyn cheered for the net's victory again and again, there were also some people who were very disgusted with the super team, including Charles Barkley.

"I don't like super teams. If they win, they win. But I want to be clear - I don't support those guys, I'm against all the super teams. I'm an old school player Barkley said.

Barkley believes that too many players succumb to the pressure to win the championship, leading to the rising willingness of the stars to form a group¡° I don't think it's any good for the game. Although we didn't win the championship, in our time, the 76ers game was definitely worth seeing, so was the Knicks, the walkers of Reggie (Miller), and so was Wilkins' Atlanta. Super teams are not good for the business of the league Barkley said.

"But now these young kids, they all succumb to peer pressure that they have to win the championship or their lives will be terrible. I feel good about my career, and I believe Patrick Ewing, John Stockton, Karl Malone do the same. LeBron James created a wave of super teams, which is the way the League works now Barkley continued.

Nowadays, the formation of "super teams" is a common phenomenon. Players no longer compete with each other, but unite to attack the championship. Whether you like or hate this trend, this is the current situation of NBA.
