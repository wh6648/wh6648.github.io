On June 11, the Jazz officially announced that guard Mike Conley will continue to miss today's Western Conference semi-final G2.

Conley was injured in the first half of the Jazz 'first round G5 win over Grizzlies on Wednesday local time. On Monday local time, Conley was limited in training for the Jazz team, so he missed the Western Conference semi-final G1.

Conley, 33, is the heart of the Jazz's backcourt and is the first all star of his career this season. In his two seasons with the jazz, Conley suffered from hamstring injuries many times. In February this year, he was absent for six games because of tight right hamstring; At the end of April and may, Conley missed nine games.

In the current Jazz offensive and defensive system, Conley is an important part. His injury means that Donovan Mitchell will take more responsibility in the backcourt.

"I hope Conley can return as soon as possible," Jazz coach Quinn Snyder said in an interview before, "but those things are difficult to control."

In the first round of the playoffs, Conley averaged 17.4 points, 8.6 assists and 3.8 rebounds.

At present, the Jazz are 1-0 ahead of the Clippers.
