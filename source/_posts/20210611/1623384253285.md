On June 11, the NBA playoffs continued. The Bucks beat the nets 86-83 to score 1-2 in the series.

This game, the letter brother 31 shot 14, won 33 points, 14 rebounds, 2 assists, leading the Bucks hard to win.

In the first two games of the series, the Bucks seemed to have no ability to fight back against the nets. The weakness of brother letterman's shooting was further magnified, and Middleton's inefficiency could not provide brother Letterman with the help he needed. What's more terrible is that the defense the Bucks relied on throughout the season seemed to have no effect in front of the nets, and the nets wanted anything at the offensive end, Or in the case of the lack of harden in the nets. This return to home, for bucks and brother letters, is not only a series of life and death, but also a need to re-establish self-confidence in the battle of redemption.

At the beginning of the game, the letter brother showed a strong desire to win the game. When he came up, he pushed up the counterattack and blocked Griffin one-stop. He avenged himself for the game. Then he continued to attack the inside line and showed his step to throw and hit. Then he hit back again and made the first nine points of the game, stopping the net directly. On the defensive side, the letter brother's terrible defensive area is also revealed. Whether it is supplementary defense or cooperative defense, the letter can complete the defensive task excellently. The Bucks as a whole unite as one, only let the nets get 11 points in the first quarter, while the letter brother scored 15 points in the first quarter, leading the bucks to a big lead.

However, in the second quarter, the situation suddenly changed. The Bucks were completely electrified at the offensive end, as if they could not play. Eight minutes before the second quarter, the Bucks only scored 3 points. The letter brother was particularly hesitant to carry out the impact of the inner line in the first quarter. He hoped to drive his teammates, but he made frequent mistakes. The shooting hand of his friends was also very bad. The Bucks got 33 points completely from the letter brother and the letter brother Middleton and Huo ledi arranged, this lets the basket's bag clip have no scruples. The Bucks lost their advantage in the first quarter because of the continuous mistakes and iron strike, and the letter lost itself in the second quarter, only relying on the free throw to get 1 point.

When Yi Bian fought again, budenhower clearly gave the letter a clear strategy to continue to attack the interior line. He first scored in the restricted area, scored Middleton's three-point goal, and then scored two points with an empty cut. Then he made a change of defense to defeat Owen and scored continuously to help the Bucks stabilize the situation. Influenced by the quotation strategy of the nets, the letters chose no ball more in the second half, and attacked the forbidden area more through air cutting and defensive exchange, which did receive good results. However, as the nets found their hand in the offensive end, the Bucks inevitably lost one and lost the other in defense, and the game also fell into a stalemate.
