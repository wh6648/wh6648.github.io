After being knocked out in the first round of the playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers will definitely adjust their lineup in this off-season period in order to attack the championship again. According to Evan Massey, Derek Ross will become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, and both the Lakers and the Knicks are interested in him.

"The Knicks absolutely want Ross to come back for another year or two," an NBA executive told reporters Evan Massey. "He's a perfect man, and coach Tom sybodou also wants to keep him on the team's roster. Of course, there are many other suitors, including the Lakers. They will be looking for a new point guard after Dennis Schroeder leaves. For the Knicks, the Lakers will be a huge threat to their introduction of Ross

Schroeder made it clear that he did not rule out a return to the Lakers. However, it is not clear whether he will really return, and Ross will be the most powerful replacement for the full back position. Rose, 32, averaged 14.7 points, 2.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists this season, shooting 47.0% and 3-point 38.8%. If he joins the Lakers, it's not known whether rose will be the starter, but it's certain that he will be a valuable contributor to the team.
