On June 11, the 2020-21 NBA playoffs continued. In the end, the Bucks beat the nets 86-83, rewriting the total score to 1-2. In the whole game, Bucks obviously put more pressure on the basketball net team at the defensive end, and the physical confrontation was obviously strengthened. Although they lost the game, Durant's performance in the last quarter was still chilling.

At the beginning of the game, the nets were constantly blocked at the offensive end, Owen and Durant were closely watched, Owen did not have too many mobile phone meetings, and the basketball nets players were unable to help them reduce pressure. The nets didn't get a point nearly four minutes after the game, which made the Bucks play 9-0.

On the Bucks' side, Middleton changed the previous two downturns and scored three points on the outside to help brother Letterman create more space to attack the inside. After the Bucks opened the outside line, the letter brother also continued to attack the inside line to cut points. In the first quarter, the Bucks once got a lead of more than 20 points and made a perfect start.

Then, Owen gradually recovered, Durant also repeatedly attack, help the nets out of the downturn, gradually catch up with the score. After that, the two teams you come and I go, the score has been biting, the suspense of the game has been extended to the final stage.

At the last moment, Durant regained his hand and made a series of strong attacks, and the Bucks also responded. Then, the nets had a chance to end the game, but the team failed to serve from the sidelines. Durant and Owen had been closely watched, and brown failed to break through the layup.

Throughout the game, Bucks compared with the previous two games significantly strengthened the defensive strength and physical confrontation, this sudden change also makes the basketball nets very uncomfortable, after the opening has been unable to find the offensive feeling. In addition, Middleton's hot hand, also let the Bucks have a certain improvement in the offensive end, no longer just rely on the letter brother to carry the team's offensive task.
