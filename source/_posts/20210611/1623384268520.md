On June 11, a fast food truck serving Philippine food was smashed and damaged in northern Utah over the weekend, with a graffiti of an aggressive picture and racial hate slogans on its body. The pictures quickly reached jazz star Jordan Clarkson's mobile phone, and the NBA's sixth best man of the season knew he had to do something after seeing the insulting and often used to attack Asian graffiti.

"If you want me to be honest, my first reaction is," this is pure bullshit...! " Clarkson told ESPN, "I thought at the time, we f --- ing can't do this. That's what I say to my son, my family and everyone around me. So they said, "let's do something."

"There's no room, especially now." Clarkson continued, "we've had a lot of hard times on this planet, in this country, in this world. There are many things happening. I think we should be together. Everyone should find a peaceful way to make the world more comfortable. We have no place to let the hatred spread. We must throw it out as soon as possible. "

It's worth mentioning that Clarkson is one of the many people who want to help repair the dining car. He paid for the cleaning and details of the car and worked with identity graphx, a car packaging company, to design a new look for the truck. In addition, Clarkson also provided a lot of financial support to owner Ben and Irene pierce to make the dining car run again.

Clarkson revealed that the Jazz invited the owners and employees of the dining car to watch the team play the second game of the clippers series¡° I don't even want to publicize it. My team asked me, do you want to make it public or not? I said, no, I did it out of love and support. But they came to me and said, you have to tell people that you are by their side and let them know that you are supporting them, and that's what I'm doing. I'm here to support you, to express my love and to try to make a difference, that's all Clarkson said.

In the United States, where hate crimes are rampant, many Asian Americans live in fear. According to the data, from March 2020 to March 2021, there were more than 6600 anti Asian hate incidents. Hate crimes against Asian Americans in the largest U.S. cities in 2020 are 145% higher than in 2019. There were verbal and physical attacks, some of which ended in deadly ways, such as the shooting of six Asian women in the Atlanta area on March 16.

"This is a big thing that we want to really change and participate in, especially in Utah." Clarkson said, "it's happening all over the world." black people's lives are also lives, "and" stop Asian hatred. "Everyone has social media, and you've seen these reports. I think this situation has been going on for a long time. I am also learning and doing a lot of things, trying to catch up with this progress. As a young player in the league, you may not really pay attention to these things, but as you get older, you will gradually accept your role

Clarkson also said the jazz, led by Ryan Smith and Dwyane Wade, tried to use their influence to promote diversity and inclusiveness and openly oppose racial hatred.

"They've done a good job trying to change this culture in Utah. If you come to our stadium, you will see the message on the notice board before the game (asking fans to curb hate behavior) Clarkson said, "you see what our team has done to Jia Morant's family. What we're trying to do is commit to change. Because we are the leaders of this community, this state and this city, and I think that's our responsibility. I think if people see us doing this, they will follow suit. "
