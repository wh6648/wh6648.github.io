On March 12, 2021, the Nets beat Celtic 121-109, with harden scoring 22 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists.

In this game, the green army limited the first attack of harden very well. After all, harden is the first in assists per game, so harden only had one successful layup in the first six minutes, but he didn't send one assists, which is extremely rare after harden joined the nets.

In the first quarter of the game, harden scored four points and made one assist, which was basically limited by the green army. Previously, harden hated to fight with the green army in the Rockets. Smart once made harden fouls twice in the last minute of a game, which was also one of the nightmares of harden's career. Therefore, harden still needs to find a gap to break the green army's layered defense system. At the beginning of the second quarter, harden directly knocked down Tatum in a breakthrough. This ball is also a typical harden style backward step.

Then it was harden who seized the chance of conversion and made fouls. Facing the green army who advocated confrontation, harden's killing move was to fight violence with violence, and showed the deterrent power of touching porcelain and confrontation. In the eighth minute of the second quarter, harden and Tatum began to fight each other. The latter hit three points in front of him in order to regain the face he had just been knocked down. In the end, harden made another single shot and responded again. In the third quarter, harden's breakthrough was effective again. He made a series of attacks successfully, and several assists also helped him find the rhythm.

In the last minute of the third quarter, harden finally met his most annoying opponent, smart. As a result, harden made a three-point foul for smart this time, and just came up in the fourth quarter, harden continued to make a killing on the breakthrough. After coming to the nets, harden averaged only 6.7 free throws per game, a new low in the past nine years. You should know that harden's free throws have been at a historical level, but in the last two seasons, the referees have set new rules for harden to make fouls and no longer give whistles easily. However, in this hand-to-hand fight with the green army, harden's nine free throws at the beginning of the fourth quarter are the highest in the past five games.

In the last five minutes of the last quarter, harden faced Tess to break through the layup again, even after the layup hit, he put his opponent out of the field. A minute later, harden returned Tatum's goal again, pressing 24 seconds to attack and lay up. To say that harden is also very ghost, although he threw a very unreliable three points in the last two minutes of the game, he wasted 24 seconds and then assisted Owen with three points. Finally, the nets defeated the green army and continued to catch up with the first in the East.
