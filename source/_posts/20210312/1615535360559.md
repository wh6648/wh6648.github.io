Since the beginning of this season, two All-Star centers, enbid and Jokic, have dominated the MVP list for a long time. Gobel and other centers have shown great bravery and attention, which seems to show a trend: in this era where the front is king, the flourishing age of center has quietly come.

Since Dr. James Naismith invented basketball, the center is the most important position in the team most of the time, because he is closest to the basket, so he is more convenient to score and control the rebound, and can control the game from both ends of attack and defense.

From 1940s to 1970s, traditional centers dominated the league, such as George McCann in 1940s to 1950s, Russell and Chamberlain in 1950s to 1960s, and Jabbar in 1960s to 1970s. In the 1980s, black and white magic and Byrd ruled the league, establishing the Laker Dynasty and Celtic Dynasty, but Jabbar and mosimaron are still one of the strongest players. Jordan ruled the league in the 1990s, but it was the era of the four centers (Olajuwon, Ewing, general Robinson and O'Neill). However, in the 1990s, the transformation sprouted. Karl Malone and Buckley liberated the power forward from the "second center" position, while Jordan pushed the guard to the peak. At the beginning of the 21st century, the situation created heroes. The League entered the era of four big forwards (Duncan, Nowitzki, Garnett and Webber) and four point guards (Kobe, Iverson, McGrady and Carter). The status of center has declined, but it is still an important part of the team. Yao Ming and Howard are still killing all sides. In several traditional systems, such as Duncan's and Robinson's Spurs' twin towers, triangle offense (Jordan's bulls, Coby O'Neill's Lakers, Coby Gasol's Lakers) and Princeton (Webb's King), traditional centers play an irreplaceable role.

The era has changed dramatically since 2010, and the traditional center has declined. This is because: first, the pick and roll system overtakes other traditional systems and becomes the mainstream of the league. A generation of masters Jerry Sloan and his disciples Karl Malone and Stockton take pick and roll to a new height, and other teams follow suit. Pick and roll is the nemesis of traditional centers. Traditional centers move slowly and can't defend themselves. There will be a big gap in the face of pick and roll. When the center of the pick and roll team has a range, it's better to snipe traditional centers. Therefore, the Lakers of O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were easily eliminated by the pick and roll system of Utah double ghost jazz in the 97 and 98 playoffs, The great Yao Ming is also helpless in the face of suns Nash and young Stoudemire's pick and roll, jazz Deron and Boozer's pick and roll.

Second, the rapid attack system has risen, the league's small ball is popular, the Golden State Warriors have pushed the small ball tactics to the extreme, all teams have played faster, the attack line inside and outside can attack, defend and roll call, which has become the mainstream of the times. The league has entered the era of multiple fronts, with LeBron, Durant, Leonard, George, Letterman and other front lines being the strongest players of the times; the back line is also full of talents, For example, curry, harden, weishao and dongqiqi. The traditional center is exhausted and unable to parry. In 2013, the pacer center Ebert, who was still ravaging bosh, suddenly lost the ball and faded out of the league.

With the decline of the traditional center, the position of center will wither. Noah (14th season) and little Jordan (16th season) can also mix in for a while. The public opinion once hoped that the position of "center" would not be set in the selection of the best lineup. The traditional center's emphasis is to fight against the fierce low position attack, For example, the low position skills such as catching the ball in the important position under the basket to get rid of the cut, shooting under the basket to pick up the basket and hit the board, waving and swinging false moves, big and small hook, cross cutting and vertical breakthrough, step by step cross step, step by step and slide step to stop abruptly, etc. and the corresponding passing are less used in the center position, On the contrary, the back line and forward line are used much more. There are more and more modern centers, which have become the standard configuration of many teams. They are either good at long-range shooting, or good at protecting the basket, or good at cutting and eating cakes, or good at picking and rolling to get rid of the following. Stoudemire, who was trained by d'antony, Okur, who was trained by Sloan in his twilight years, and Howard, who was trained by magic, are the pioneers of modern centers. A few years before the era of small ball, the center was willing to play a supporting role in the green leaf, working as a role player around the front and back line. Although the strongest kausins has excellent offensive means, he has low scoring efficiency and poor performance in leading the team. Although he is known as the "first center", he has been criticized and can not justify the name of the center.

In recent years, there has been a gap in the history of basketball. Star centers such as nbid, Jokic, Downes, gobel, vucevich, sabonis Jr. and Aton have quietly risen and become the hot spots in the league. Star players such as Nongmei, Adebayor, jaren Jackson Jr., wood and Collins have drifted away from the position of power forward and center, and they are also the leaders for a while, Turner, Capella, nurkic, Harrell and other jigsaw centers also gave satisfactory answers, and the center showed signs of blowout.

The Philadelphia 76ers center, enbid, inherits the traditional centers such as olajuwan and Ewing. He has a kaleidoscope of offensive skills, such as face frame, back frame, projection, breakthrough, cut in, wide range, rich footwork, forward cross step, forward turn, backward turn, defensive end can assist in defense and basket protection. This season, the Philadelphia 76ers sent off hofford and no longer played double towers. They brought in Seth curry and Denny green, which made Simmons devote his energy to organizing fast attack and defense, optimized the team's offensive space, and made him a killer in the interior. Philadelphia ranked first in the East.

Nuggets center joachi inherits and surpasses traditional centers such as sabonis and Divac. He can hold the ball inside and outside, can have no ball, can back the frame, can face the frame, can jump and throw, and has a very smooth hand. He also has a historical level of organizational vision, and can attack the team in series. He and Murray's duet make the opponent press the gourd to float.

Thick eyebrow is the top pancake eater and super defender in history, who can defend from No.1 to No.5. After adding low skill in the 20th season, he became a low position killer. Downes has the same comprehensive skill, especially the ability of three-point center in history.

Jazz center Gerber took another road, his main skill is to defend the basket, his defense can cover the shooting area, the absolute DPOY level. The offensive side relies on pick and roll, but he supports the defensive foundation of the team. Mitchell, Conley, ingers, Clarkson and Boyang take charge of the attack, making the Jazz Top in the west this season.

In the era of big data, magic ball prevails, and three-point and restricted area attack become the mainstream, which makes the traditional center's low position singles once abandoned, but now it is picked up by the centers, because more and more people find that in the bloodthirsty time of the playoffs, low position singles and center throw, which are rare technologies, can sometimes become the magic weapon to win. In the 20th season, the Laker center, Nongmei, used a lot of low position singles and center shots to win the championship. So more and more centers, such as joachi, enbid and Downes, have learned low skills.

The rise of centers is due to the spiral development of history. There are talented people in the world of basketball. There is no shortage of talented centers. They just need time to adapt to the new trend of the league. As they slowly absorb new skills, they are bound to rise. For example, many centers have added three-point projection skills, which are familiar to enbid, Jokic, Nongmei and Downes. Some also assiduously draw nutrients from traditional center skills. Enbid learned the steps of "big dream" olajuwan from youtube, and then he specialized in looking for big dream special training, and eventually achieved great success. Jokic widely absorbed the European team center playing method, and his duet playing method with Murray even vaguely saw the taste of Princeton system. Even if he is more traditional, such as Gerber, he has become a top paid center by defense.
