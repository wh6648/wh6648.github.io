March 12, 2020-21 season NBA regular season continues, Brooklyn nets home against Boston Celtic. After playing the net 121-109 repel the green shirt, ushering in three consecutive wins.

Green shirt side Tatum air cut 31 points and 5 rebounds, Jay Brown 23 shot only 5 in 13 points, the performance contrast is huge.

Frankly speaking, Celtic's performance in the first half of this season was lower than expected. After 36 games, they only won 19 and ranked fourth in the East.

Of course, this situation is related to the team lineup is not neat, the general injured in turn.

However, after the all star game, with the recovery of smart, the green army gradually close to the whole team. Today's away challenge to the super team nets is a good test for the green army.

In terms of paper strength, the green army's lineup is not inferior to the nets. After all, Durant, the core of the opposition, is still injured, and Griffin, the new recruit, has not appeared. In contrast, the attack points of the green army are very scattered. In the first quarter, kenba Walker takes the lead in making a three-point net and a layup, while the double core Jay brown and Tatum who are close to him are relatively low-key.

Tatum after the opening focus on coordination and contain Brown's hand is not good, but in the defensive end, he is quite involved in the continuous delivery of alert steals. Under the leadership of walker, the Green Army established an advantage in a single quarter, and the 9 points he got also suppressed Owen in terms of efficiency.

It's just that Walker's touch is only maintained one quarter after another. With the defensive strength of the net, his standard is gradually lost. But the green army did not panic, they quickly opened up a new attack mode, Tatum began to stand up, during a consecutive layup, a three-point into the light. When the green army's attack completely stopped, and the team-mates' delivery became more and more difficult, Tatum continued to hold up the team. He used "Kobe's step" in positional warfare and made a difficult mid-range backward jump shot to seize the score.

Entering the third quarter, the competition became more and more fierce, and Tatum continued to display his scoring skills in the attack. What's more surprising is that smart, who has just come back around him, has given great firepower support. At the end of the third quarter, the time when both sides had to fight for each point was when Smart's two three-point goals helped the green shirt to hold the score tightly. In addition, this section, Jay Brown also found some scoring touch.

In the third quarter, Owen's attacking universe was fully inspired. He stopped and shot 30 points after his signature dribble. At the end of the game, it was also his containment that created opportunities for his teammates and created a 10 point advantage.
