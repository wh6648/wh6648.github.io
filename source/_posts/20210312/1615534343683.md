On March 12, 2021, the Nets beat the Celtics 121-109 and Owen scored 40 points and 8 rebounds.

Owen's most powerful weapon this season is still single. He ranks fifth in the league by scoring single points per game this season, and he is still the best defender in the league. After the start, Owen tried to lay up against brown, but was influenced by his opponent. In fact, Owen was not very happy in the green team before, so this game is also a return for Owen to face the old owners.

Of course, it's not so easy to retaliate. The green army are still very familiar with Owen. They limit Owen's possession of the ball through various dislocation and pick and roll defense. Owen can't even get the ball. Owen only hit a sports goal in the first seven minutes. However, in the second half of the first quarter, Owen had two chances to grab points, one was riding archery, the other was chasing.

After coming back in the second quarter, Owen hit a single shot, which made the net fall into a passive position from the beginning and finally tied the green army. Owen's fighting ability against his old club is the key to regain the lead in the second quarter of the net. He constantly uses speed to tear up the green army's defense. When he and harden's half court assists add up to less than five times, the green army's biggest fear may be Owen's disorderly fighting method, which can not only hold the ball but also be faster than everyone else. In the last three minutes of the second quarter, with Owen hitting the chase three points again, Owen made five rebounds in the last six shots and overtook the net by six points.

In the last minute of the half-time, the green team chased the points or Owen came out to snatch the points against Tess, a super high throw backward. This killing move has become Owen's best weapon when facing the big man. In the first quarter, Owen scored to solve the problem when he came back from the backward node of the net. In the third quarter, the green army came up to play the climax. After Nash's pause, he arranged Owen to fight alone. As a result, Owen solved the dilemma again with a three-point shot in a row.

In the seventh minute of the third quarter, Owen made a breakthrough and then put the ball in with a slight lift when facing Tatum's defender who had already flown out of the field. In the last three minutes of the third quarter, Owen turned into a single brown. As a result, Owen made a huge fake turn to stop the opponent in the same place, and then he threw back. A minute later, Owen made a three-point shot and tied. In the second and third quarters, Owen's strong output ability made the green army helpless. Smart Brown Tatum Walker Owen played all over the world by himself.

In the last four minutes of the last quarter, both sides had already killed red eye. Owen faced three people in a breakthrough, which caused a foul. In the last three minutes, Owen dribbled just after half-time. He didn't expect to make a three-point shot directly. This unreasonable three-point led the nets to get seven points again and established the victory. In the last minute and 59 seconds, Owen made another three-point shot and then made a foul to take the game away. In the end, the nets got off to a good start after defending the home court and defeating the green all stars.
