On March 12, 2021, the Nets beat Celtic 121-109, Owen scored 40 points and 8 rebounds.

Owen's most powerful weapon this season is still single. He ranks fifth in the league by scoring single points per game this season, and he is still the best defender in the league. After the start, Owen tried to lay up against brown, but was influenced by his opponent. In fact, Owen was not very happy in the green team before, so this game is also a return for Owen to face the old owners.

Of course, it's not so easy to retaliate. The green army are still very familiar with Owen. They limit Owen's possession of the ball through all kinds of dislocation and pick and roll defense. Many times, Owen can't even get the ball. In the first seven minutes, Owen scored in a sports game. However, in the second half of the first quarter, Owen had two chances to grab points, one was riding archery, the other was chasing.

After coming back in the second quarter, Owen hit a single shot backward, which made the net fall into the passive position from the beginning and finally tied the green army. Owen's combat effectiveness against his old team is the key to regain the lead in the second quarter of the net. He constantly tears the green army's defense with speed. When he and harden's half-time assists are less than five times, the green army's biggest fear may be Owen's disorderly fighting method, which can not only hold the ball, but also be faster than everyone else. In the last three minutes of the second quarter, with Owen hitting the chase three points again, Owen shot five times in the last six times, and the net also exceeded 6 points.

In the last minute of the half-time, the green team chased the points, and Owen came out to grab the points. Facing a super high throw from Tess, this killing move has become Owen's best weapon against the big man. In the first quarter, Owen scored to solve the problem when he came back from the backward node of the net. In the third quarter, the green army came up to play the climax. After Nash's pause, he arranged Owen to fight alone. As a result, Owen made a three-point shot in a row and solved the dilemma again.

In the seventh minute of the third quarter, Owen performed an extreme operation. After breaking through, when facing Tatum's defense, the man had already flown out of the field, he gently raised his hand and put the ball in. In the last three minutes of the third quarter, Owen turned into a single brown. As a result, Owen made a huge fake turn to stop the opponent in the same place, and then he threw back. A minute later, Owen made another three-point shot and tied. In the second and third quarters, Owen's powerful output ability made the green army helpless. Smart, brown, Tatum, Walker and Owen played all over the team individually.

In the last four minutes of the last quarter, both sides had already killed red eyes. Owen made a foul when facing three people in a breakthrough. In the last three minutes, Owen dribbled just after half-time, but he didn't expect to make a three-point shot directly. This unreasonable three-point allowed the nets to regain a 7-point lead and established the victory. In the last minute and 59 seconds, Owen made another three-point shot, then made a foul and took the game away. In the end, the nets defended the home court and defeated the green army, and made a good start after the all star.
