Frankly speaking, Celtic's performance in the first half of this season was lower than expected. After 36 games, they only got 19 wins, ranking fourth in the East.

Of course, the emergence of such a situation, with the team lineup is not neat, the general injured in turn.

However, after the all star game, with the recovery of smart, the green army gradually close to the whole team. Today away challenge super team nets, for the green army is a good test.

In terms of paper strength, the green army's lineup is not inferior to the nets. After all, in the opposition, Durant is still injured and Griffin has not appeared. In contrast, the attack points of the green army are very scattered. In the first quarter, kenba Walker takes the lead. He gets a three-point net and a layup. Beside him, the double core Jay brown and Tatum are relatively low-key.



Just, Walker's hand only maintained a quarter, the next quarter, with the strength of the rebound defense, his star gradually lost. But the green army didn't panic, they quickly opened a new attack mode, Tatum began to stand up for continuous points, during which he made a layup and three points at a time. When the green army's attack completely stopped, and when his teammates had more and more difficulties in getting the ball out, Tatum continued to support the team. He used "Kobe's steps" in positional warfare, and made a difficult mid-range backward jump shot to seize the score.

Entering the third quarter, the competition became more and more fierce. In the attack, Tatum continued to display his scoring skills calmly. What's more surprising is that in his side, just comeback smart gave great firepower support. At the end of the third quarter, when the two sides had to fight for each point, it was smart's two three-point goals that helped the green shirt to hold the score tightly. In addition, this section, Jay Brown also found some scoring feel.

In the third quarter, Owen's attacking universe was fully inspired. He stopped and shot after a series of dribbles and scored 30 points. In the last quarter, it was also his containment, which created opportunities for his teammates, and then created a 10 point advantage.
