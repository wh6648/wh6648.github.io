On March 12, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued, with the Los Angeles Clippers playing Golden State Warriors at home. After a 130-104 victory over the clippers, the warriors stopped losing three times in a row.

On the warriors side, Stephen curry was in the doldrums, 6-out-of-16, 1-out-of-8

All star cecuri went to Atlanta in a hurry, but without much preparation, he easily won the three-point championship.

However, the three-point champion did not give the warriors the slightest incentive. Return to the regular season warriors, the first half of the first encounter with a powerful clipper, and a come on into the passive.

In the first quarter, it was extremely difficult for curry to dribble and catch the ball.

In the first quarter, Kuri didn't get three points into the net, only got two points by layup. The only bright spot was on the defensive side, when the Clippers core Leonard was preparing to turn over and shoot with the ball, but he didn't see curry coming from the side. Small card only to avoid the front of the defender, backward range is very big, but cold, Curie high jump will he shot hard to press down.

The defense of the ball shows that mengshen's toughness on the defensive end has activated his state. In the second quarter, curry hit two more goals from the layup, but because of the outside touch, he couldn't score in a string, and the warriors gradually fell into the disadvantage in the attack.

Yi Bian fought again, and curry finally received the dream - Green's pass to hit his first three points of the game, but also let the score barely break through the double digits. Unfortunately, at this time the warriors have been behind by more than 20 points, whether in the offensive or defensive are basically lost morale. And Curry's three-point goal has not played any role in reversing the situation and boosting morale.

In the middle of the season, the warriors only rank ninth in the West. Although they are only one step away from the top eight, considering the warriors' total value plus luxury tax of $300 million, the performance is still too low.

Today's warriors are in an embarrassing situation. On the one hand, the management still hopes that the lineup can be further integrated and the young people can continue to grow. On the other hand, with high salary contracts like Wiggins and ubre, the warriors are always thinking about trading.

Most of the night, curry is the warrior's player, and once he's dumb, there's no suspense. Today, the problem is even more prominent. With two minutes left in the third quarter, curry returned to the bench and clocked out early.
