Since the beginning of this season, two All-Star centers, enbid and Jokic, have dominated the MVP list for a long time. Gobel and other centers have performed bravely and strikingly, which seems to show a trend. In this era of attack, the flourishing age of center has come quietly.

Since Dr. James Naismith invented basketball, the center is the most important position of the team most of the time, because he is closest to the basket, so he is more convenient to score and control the backboard, and can control the game from both ends of attack and defense.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, traditional centers dominated the league, such as George McCann in the 1940s and 1950s, Russell in the 1950s and 1960s and Chamberlain Jabbar in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, black and white magic and Byrd ruled the league and established the Laker Dynasty and Celtic Dynasty, but Jabbar and mosimaron are still one of the strongest players. Jordan ruled the league in the 1990s, but it was the era of four centers Olajuwon, Ewing, general Robinson and O'Neal. However, in the 1990s, there was a bud of transformation. Karl Malone and Buckley liberated the power forward from the "second center" position, while Jordan pushed the guard to the peak. At the beginning of the 21st century, the League of heroes entered the era of four strikers Duncan, Nowitzki, Garnett and Webber, and four point guards Kobe, Iverson, McGrady and Carter. Although the status of center has declined, Yao Ming and Howard are still important members of the team. In several traditional systems, the double tower system, such as Duncan and Robinson's Spurs double towers, Jordan's bulls in triangle attack, Kobe O'Neill's Laker, Kobe Gasol's Laker and Princeton Weber's King traditional center, plays an irreplaceable role.

The era changed dramatically after 2010, and the traditional center declined. This is because first, the pick and roll system overtakes other traditional systems and becomes the mainstream of the league. Generation master Jerry Sloan and his disciples Karl Malone and Stockton take pick and roll to a new height, and other teams follow suit. Pick and roll is the nemesis of the traditional center. The traditional center moves slowly and can't prevent it. There will be a big gap in the face of pick and roll. When the center of the pick and roll team has a range, it can snipe the traditional center better. Therefore, the Lakers of O'Neill and Kobe Bryant were easily eliminated by the pick and roll system of Utah's jazz in the 97 and 98 playoffs The great Yao Ming is also helpless in the face of suns Nash and young Stoudemire's pick and roll, jazz Deron and Boozer's pick and roll.

Second, the rise of the fast attack system, the popularity of the League small ball, Golden State Warriors to the extreme small ball tactics, the teams play faster, attack inside and outside, defense, roll call become the mainstream of the times, the League entered the era of multi front, LeBron, Durant, Leonard, George, Letterman and other fronts are the strongest players of the times, the back line is also talented For example, curry, harden, weishao and dongqiqi. The traditional center is exhausted and unable to fight back the Pacers who still ravaged bosh in 2013. Center Ebert suddenly has no ball to play out of the league.

With the decline of traditional center position, Noah's 14 season and little Jordan's 16 season center with mediocre ability can also be mixed into a storm of public opinion. For a time, it was hoped that the "center" position would not be set in the selection of the best lineup. The traditional center highly praised the boxing to the meat, against the fierce low position attack, such as the basket to catch the ball to get rid of the cut, the basket shot to pick up the board, swing the fake action, big and small hook, cross cutting and vertical breakthrough, step by step cross step, step by step sliding step stop and so on Low position skills such as coordination passing are less used in the center position, but more used in the guard line and forward line. Modern centers have become more and more standard for many teams. They are good at long-range shooting, basket protection, air cutting and cake eating, or pick and roll. Stoudemire, who was trained by d'antony, Okur, who was trained by Sloan in his twilight years, and Howard, who was trained by magic, are the pioneers of modern centers. A few years before the era of small ball, the center was willing to be a green leaf supporting role, and worked as a role player around the front guard line. Although the strongest kausins has excellent offensive means, he has low scoring efficiency and poor team performance. Although he is known as the "first center", he has been criticized for not being able to correct the name of the center.

In recent years, there have been gaps in the history of basketball. Star centers, such as nbid, Jokic, Downes, gobel, vucevich, sabonis and Aton, have quietly risen to become the hot spots in the league. The star players, such as Nongmei, Adebayor, jaren Jackson, wood and Collins, have drifted away from the position of power forward and center for a while Turner, Capella, nurkic, Harrell and other jigsaw centers also gave satisfactory answers, and the center showed signs of blowout.

Philadelphia 76ers center enbid is a teacher of traditional centers such as olajuwan and Ewing. He has a kaleidoscope of offensive skills, such as face frame, back frame, projection, breakthrough, cut in range, wide range, rich footwork, forward cross step, backward turn, backward turn, and defensive end, which can assist in defense and basket protection. This season, the Philadelphia 76ers sent off hofford and no longer played double towers. They introduced Cesc curry and Denny green to let Simmons focus on organizing fast attack and defense, optimizing the team's offensive space. When enby Denton became a killer in the interior, Philadelphia ranked first in the East.

Nuggets center joachi inherits and surpasses traditional centers such as sabonis and diwaz. He can hold the ball inside and outside, can have no ball, can back the frame, can face the frame, can throw suddenly, and has a very smooth shooter sense. He also has a historical level of organizational vision, and can connect the team to attack. He and Murray's duet makes the opponent press the gourd to float.

Thick eyebrow is the top pancake eater and super defender in history. He can defend from No.1 position to No.5 position. In 20 seasons, he increased his low skills and became a low position killer. Downes has the same comprehensive skills, especially his historical three-point center ability.

Jazz center Gerber took another road. His main skill is to defend the basket. His defense can cover the absolute DPOY level of the shooting area. The offensive side relies on pick and roll, but he supports the defensive foundation of the team. Mitchell, Conley, ingers, Clarkson and Boyang are in charge of the attack, making the Jazz Top in the west this season.

In the era of big data, magic ball prevails, three-point and forbidden area attack become the mainstream, which makes the traditional center's low point singles once abandoned, but now it is picked up by the centers, because more and more people find that in the bloodthirsty time of the playoffs, low point singles and center shots, which are rare technologies, can sometimes become the magic weapon to win. In the 20th season, the Laker center Nongmei used a lot of low position singles and central shots to win the championship. So more and more centers, such as joachi, enbid and Downes, have learned low skills.

The rise of centers is due to the spiral development of history. There is no shortage of talented centers in the basketball world. They just need time to adapt to the new trend of the league. As they slowly absorb new skills, they are bound to rise. For example, many centers have added three-point projectors, which are familiar to nengbid, Jokic, Nongmei and Downes. Some also assiduously draw nutrients from the traditional center skills. Enbid learned the steps of "big dream" olajuwan from youtube, and then he specialized in looking for big dream special training. Eventually, there was a great success. Joachi widely absorbed the European team center playing method. His duet with Murray even vaguely saw the taste of Princeton system. Even if it's more traditional, such as gobel, he has become the top paid center by defense.
