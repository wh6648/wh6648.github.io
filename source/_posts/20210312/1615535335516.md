On March 12, according to Rockets coach Silas, Tucker will no longer represent the Rockets.

According to shams, PJ Tucker and the Rockets have reached a consensus that he will not stay with the team any longer, and both sides are finding a final solution.

Coach Silas said after the game that PJ Tucker had already arrived in saramento, but returned to Houston tonight. Coach Silas said the best way is not to let him stay here.

"We'll find a way to solve this problem, to his satisfaction and to our satisfaction. For now, he will not be with the team again. I thought he would play tonight, but he didn't, which is very disappointing

Asked how he made the decision to keep him out of the Rockets game against Sacramento, coach Silas said, "he said he didn't want to play, we thought it was a good idea, so that's it."

With less than two weeks to go before the deadline, the Rockets have lost 14 games in a row. PJ Tucker may have finished his last game in the Rockets.

According to Tim Macmahon, the Rockets have been discussing a tucker deal with multiple teams in recent weeks, and the specific deal is expected to be reached before the deadline.
