On March 4, Portland Trail Blazers announced yesterday that 13 players had been vaccinated, and said they would continue to make use of the team's platform to promote awareness of the safety, effectiveness and importance of vaccination through public service announcements and other information channels. However, not everyone is vaccinated. Andrew Wiggins, a Golden State warrior player, said publicly that he would not be vaccinated.

"Unless I'm enforced, I really don't think I'm going to get the new vaccine in a short time." Said Wiggins.

It is worth mentioning that other players in the league have been vaccinated, including New Orleans Pelican player colo Melly, who is also one of the first players to be vaccinated. "We have to believe in science. I've been vaccinated and now I feel very good. I hope my family in Italy will also get vaccinated, so that life can slowly return to normal Melly said.

In early March, Xiao Hua, President of the league, said in an interview that the league would not require anyone to be vaccinated, but he believed that "most players" would eventually choose to be vaccinated. Part of the reason the alliance is interested in vaccinating is that vaccines can make the current alliance's epidemic prevention easier. At present, under the NBA's health and safety agreement, players are not only tested three times a day, but are also subject to isolation restrictions, even if they do not test positive for people in "close contact".
