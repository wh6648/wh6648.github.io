On March 24, a well-known NBA reporter, Samas chalaniya, reported that the Raptors star Pascal siakam was fined $50000 by the Raptors for using excessive words to coach Nick NASS, according to a well-informed source.

The Raptors lost to the Cavaliers on Monday, which made him feel very disappointed and depressed. After the game, he was angry at NASS. The source said that at that time, siakam said a lot of inappropriate words to NASS, and the words were very fierce.

The Raptors are in poor shape, currently suffering 9 losses in a row, including losing to the Rockets which had lost 20 in a row on Tuesday. It is pointed out that the Raptors have begun to have some internal problems.

Xacam is one of the heroes of the Raptors to win the championship in 2019. That summer, after Coway Leonard decided to leave Toronto, the Raptors signed a four-year top salary contract with seacam, worth $130 million. At that time, the Raptors regarded xiakam as the core of the team and the cornerstone of the future. But in the past two years, the performance of siakam did not meet expectations.

So far this season, the 26 year old has played 34 games, averaging 35.3 minutes, 19.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.2 steals.
