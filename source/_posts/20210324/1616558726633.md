On March 24, NBA officials announced today that New York Knicks forward Julius Randall was fined $15000 for making improper remarks on the court and publicly criticizing the referee after the game.

Randall fouled Harris at the last minute of the extra time between the Knicks and the 76ers, which eventually led to Harris's free throw. After the game, Randall slammed the referee in an interview.

"The referee's decision It's outrageous, outrageous that they decide the game with a penalty. They have to do their work better. There are too many such games Randall said after the game.

So far this season, a number of players have received tickets from the League for criticizing referees. Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy gobel, Los Angeles Clippers star Paul George. It is worth mentioning that Randall had a dispute with the referee on duty in his previous game with the nets. At that time, Randall chose a three-point shot when facing Owen on the outside line. Randall, who was disturbed by Owen, was sent off by the referee. This decision completely angered Randall, constantly asked the referee for a statement, angry Randall directly left the court, and pushed the chair away from the court. Then the League clarified in the last two minutes of the referee's report that foster had made the right decision.

So far this season, Randall has averaged 37.0 minutes, 23.0 points, 11.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists.
