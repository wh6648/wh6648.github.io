March 24 news, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Cole revealed that according to the latest news confirmed that team star Stephen Curry's MRI results have been released, he will be absent for at least another week due to inflammation of the tailbone.

Curry is dealing with a contusion of the caudal vertebrae, which seems to be more serious than expected. Curry was injured in the away game against the rockets on March 18, when he fell to the ground after three points of throwing the whistle, resulting in a tailbone injury and early withdrawal from the game. Curry has been out of the team's last two games because of a tailbone injury. Today, he is playing the 76ers at home. Curry will continue to watch.

Previously in an interview, coach Cole did not give a specific timetable for deli's return: "he is not completely ready." Originally, it was reported that curry's injury was not serious, but this morning, curry underwent an MRI examination, which showed some inflammation in his caudal vertebrae.

"The results showed that curry's tailbone was inflamed and he had to miss at least three games, which was longer than we expected." Coach Cole said.

Due to the absence of curry, the warriors have to make some adjustments to the lineup, coach Cole has come up with a solution to the problem - rookie James Wiseman. Cole has confirmed that the 19-year-old rookie will start for the rest of the team.

"I expect James (Wiseman) to start all the rest of the season." Cole told Anthony Slater of the atomic.

Wiseman has suffered from injuries before, and recently missed three games because of the league's health and safety agreement. However, the warriors, a precious young player, has been allowed to play in today's game against the Philadelphia 76ers. According to Cole, Wiseman will play an important role in the warriors' progress. So far this season, Wiseman has averaged 11.8 points, 6 rebounds and 52.6% shooting percentage,
