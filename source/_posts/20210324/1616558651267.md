On March 24, Schroeder and Harrell had a steady performance in the Lakers' disastrous defeat to the pelicans. The former scored 15 points and 7 assists with 10 of 12 free throws, while the latter came off the bench and scored 18 points and 6 rebounds.

Schroeder came up with a beautiful 3-point shot to score, and then he made a decisive breakthrough to create fouls, two free throws. After Harrell came on as a substitute, he also made fouls under the basket and made two free throws. After that, Harrell made fouls again. After four free throws in a row, he made a layup under the basket and also caused the opponent's fouls. Then Harrell made fouls again and scored 8 points in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Schroeder took the lead in making fouls when he came back. Unfortunately, he only made one of the two free throws, and then Schroeder missed scoring opportunities one after another. His condition didn't look good. Harrell, who had a good performance in the first quarter, also lost the accuracy in this quarter. He failed to hit the free throw twice and only relied on the layup to get 2 points. After that, he wanted to change the attack mode and failed to hit the half shot.

In the third quarter of the game, the opponent Lewis hit 3 points on Schroeder's head, and then Schroeder wanted to change the color, which was covered by Lewis. Then Schroeder relied on the free throw to get 2 points. Harrell played under the basket in this competition, but he didn't know what to do with half the basket. Then Harrell cut into the layup to score. Unfortunately, his penalty still failed to play.
