Clay Thompson's reimbursement in the off-season is no different from a bolt from the blue for the warriors, but Joe lakob, the boss of the warriors, did not give up his hope of winning the championship. It is hard to find a superstar of such historical level as curry. The warriors still want to use his surplus heat to build competitiveness, so they chose potential rookie Wiseman and traded him to ubre, With curry, dream green and Wiggins to build a strong team, the team paid a huge luxury tax of 137.2 million. But it backfired. So far this season, the Golden State Warriors' record has been declining, falling out of the top eight in the western region, and there is no sign of improvement. This is because the management and the coaching staff of the warriors have made serious mistakes. Their guiding ideology is not unified. Which is more important, training new players or attacking the playoffs? The management of the warriors wants to have both fish and bear's paw, and they are not willing to let go, which leads to a chaotic situation.

From 2015 to 2019, the warriors have built a five-year three championship Dynasty, based on the small ball passing and cutting system built by coach Cole and based on kulila space. The team designed the tactics of screen pick and roll, air cut and counter run, pass ball and hand to hand to create a mercury like pass and cut attack system. Curry is the core of tactics. He either pulls the opponent's space and catches the ball by running without the ball, or organizes to dominate the ball (fast shooting or passing after single block). Clay is curry's "wingman", with the historical level of three-point ability to cooperate with curry to tear up the opponent's space (his ability to hold the ball is ordinary, only limited to the breakthrough under unmanned defense); dream chasing green is the team's dealer, sharing the pressure of curry's holding the ball, not only can he cooperate with curry in pick and roll, but also can pass the ball for his teammates, at the same time, he is the core of the team's defense. Relying on this set of top space, Durant easily cut and harvest leeks, and the warriors established a famous Dynasty.

However, with Durant's departure and clay's reimbursement, the ball passing and cutting system collapsed. The ambitious warriors, with curry and green as the core, successively added Wiggins, ubre and Wiseman. However, the warrior system has fatal defects. This system is accurate to seconds, complicated, and a little bit wrong is a mistake. It is extremely difficult to learn and understand, and requires high basketball intelligence. Fortunately, during the dynasty, the warriors gathered a large number of golfers, such as Barnes, igodara, Bogut, Livingston, David West and Zaza pachuria. This system can also cultivate players and dream that green has become a first-class star; Ezeri, spez, Rooney, cook, jerebko, Jones, Pascal and Damien Lee (siddell Curry's husband, Stephen Curry's brother-in-law) and other role players have also found a place, provided that the players have a correct attitude, study the tactical system, and enhance the players' awareness. This system is not friendly to basketball players with low intelligence and strong physical fitness, such as McKee and colestan, who have few playing time.

This season, the warriors still insist on passing and cutting the ball, playing very fast, with 103 rounds (the second in the League), but the attack efficiency is only 108.6 (the 21st in the League), and the success rate is very low. They are not the "Cosmos brave" of that year. Wiggins is a ten thousand year potential stock. He is famous for his Buddhist regimen (often drinking wolfberry water for maintenance). He is jokingly called "able to fight until 60". He relies on his top talent to fish in the warrior system. Wubule's physical fitness is strong, but he is a general player with rough skills. He has spent a lot of effort to muddle around. The two are now in line, and all the blame is on rookie Wiseman.

Wiseman is the top player in 2020, with strong physical fitness. The draft template is thick eyebrow. Unfortunately, due to illegal recruitment, NCAA has only played three games. The management of warriors regards it as a raw material to supplement the team's center vacancy. It's a pity that Wiseman's player is too low to match his real name.

The warrior system has high requirements for center players. First, they have to be able to run and score; second, they have to be able to cover, such as back cover, lower cover, side cover, double cover, high cover, horizontal withdrawal cover, cross cover, and screen the screen; third, they have to be able to coordinate, grasp the passing time accurately, neither early nor late; fourth, they have to be able to defend, Warriors play one big four small, the center guard basket pressure is very big. So Bogut, pachuria and David West of the golfer become a system puzzle, and they are all mixed up; McKee and calistan of the low golfer can't play a role.

Wiseman is comparable to McKee. He often makes mistakes in running position, attacks and catches the ball, and makes an average of 1.6 mistakes per game. He is also obsessed with singles. He likes to hit blindly in the interior line or make excessive shots in the three-point line, with a three-point shooting rate of only 32.4%, and an offensive efficiency of only 98%. He can't stop people in blocking and rolling, not to mention complicated covering. He has poor blocking position, poor rebounding protection and second attack, with an average of 5.9 rebounds per game, poor defensive change and basket protection, and often misses people, The efficiency of defense is as low as 110. In a word, this is a complete young man.

Cole has criticized him in public: "he's always trying different things, but he should know his strengths." He also reduced playing time and scolded: "training players is not equal to giving playing time. If you don't correct your mistakes, there will be less time."

However, the management of warriors has tentatively decided that it is the key to cultivate new talents, and Cole can only use it with a stiff head. He is faced with two dilemmas: first, whether to continue to attack the playoffs or give up the playoffs to cultivate new talents; second, whether to use the communication and cutting system or simplify the system.

33 year old curry has reached a new high in the era of Cole. He is in a hot state, averaging 29.7 points (three-point shooting rate is 41%), but his record has dropped again and again. Green's performance of pursuing dreams is declining, seemingly incurable; while Wiggins and ubre are just the bastards of the warrior system, Wiseman is a mess. The warriors' playoff competitors include spurs, grizzlies, kings and pelicans, which are under great pressure. If the warriors want to stand out in the playoffs, they may only overuse the main force and increase Curry's playing time, which will increase the risk of injury. They also have to cut the playing time of Wiseman, Poole and manien, and delay the training plan, which is not consistent with the idea of the warriors' management.

However, if we give up the playoffs and try our best to cultivate new players such as Wiseman, Poole and manien, Wiseman's talent will be visible to the naked eye, but he does not show his potential for the time being; "red Mamba" manien shows three points and organizational potential, Poole has a certain three-point potential; playing time for new players is not guaranteed, and his performance also fails to live up to the efforts of warriors boss and curry.

The warriors' passing and cutting system once brought the team into the dynasty, but it was too complex for the players to adapt to it, and they could not make the best use of the material and the talents. After successive defeats, Cole followed the advice of pabail Sidhu, director of innovation analysis (Wiseman and curry had the highest efficiency in pick and roll), simplified the passing and cutting system, increased the proportion of pick and roll, and reduced the learning difficulty. Wiseman can simply run to pick and roll, get rid of the following or shooting, and do not need to learn the complicated running, which is conducive to his growth; players with low basketball IQ, Wiggins and ubre, can also better integrate into the system. But this fundamentally changed the warriors' basic playing style. Green's role was reduced, and his holding power was also reduced. Meanwhile, curry had to hold the ball for a long time, such as Nash, James, Paul and harden. It's different from the way curry is used to playing. It's uncertain whether he can still maintain a sense of three-way break-up. Therefore, Cole dare not rashly increase the number of pick and roll. He once said: "the team lacks a perfect combination of players to support a large number of pick and roll tactics for the time being."
