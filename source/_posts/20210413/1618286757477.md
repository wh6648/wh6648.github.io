April 13 news, according to previous reports, Brooklyn nets star Carey Owen will be absent from the team's game with wolves for personal reasons. Although fans are used to players' rotation, there are still some people dissatisfied with Owen's decision, including the famous basketball commentator Stephen A. Smith.

A-smith in the program impolitely criticized Owen's decision, and asked Owen what he wanted: "what's the matter with Carey Owen?"

"You (Owen) only played 20 games for Brooklyn last year and took a nine month break. You didn't take part in the semi-finals held in Orlando Disneyland, and then you encouraged everyone not to take part in the semi-finals because you wanted people to focus on other issues. Now it seems that you have a lot of problems. No matter what they are, no one wants anything negative. We want everything to be good and everyone to be good. We all know that he is excellent, he is a superstar, he is the box office guarantee, but I don't remember Owen saying at any time, "this is your money, you don't need to pay me." you are not only absent from the game, let me tell you, chemical reaction and continuity are very important things. " A-smith said.

"But you (Owen) can decide to be absent. I mean, how much 'personal time' do you need? You don't play every day. You only need to play 72 games this season instead of 82. What's the matter?" a-smith asked.

It is worth mentioning that due to the tragic incident of the police shooting down darente Wright in Minneapolis, there has been a continuous protest movement there. Today's game between the nets and the Timberwolves has been postponed. It is reported that the game is likely to restart on Wednesday.
