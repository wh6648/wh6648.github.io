On April 13, NBA officials announced that Jason Tatum of Celtic team and Paul George of clippers team won the best player in East and west last week.

Tatum won the best of the week for the second time this season. Tatum, 23, led the green team to 3-1 last week, averaging 31.5 points (1 in the East), 8.5 rebounds and 3.8 assists. Tatum scored 25 + 10 in all three green team wins, the first green team player since Paul Pierce in 2003.

As a two time all star, Tatum made 16 of 25 shots in the green army's defeat of the Timberwolves and scored the highest 53 points in a single game in his career. As a result, Tatum surpassed Larry Bird to become the youngest Mr. 50 in the history of the green army. Meanwhile, Tatum has become the first green player to score at least 50 points and 10 rebounds in a single game since Byrd in 1989.

Last week, "pickled pepper" got 30 + for three consecutive games. Against the Suns on April 8 local time, George became the first clipper to score at least 30 points in two consecutive games and score six three-thirds. George scored 22 points in the first quarter against the blazers on April 6 local time, the fastest scoring player for the Clippers since 2014.
