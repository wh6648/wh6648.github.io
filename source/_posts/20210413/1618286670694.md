Pelican won two times in a row against king, who has lost six times in a row. The two sides are not in the same level at all. The two sides are the key opponents in the playoff, but from the current situation, king is slowly falling out of the competition group, while pelican is still working hard for the number of playoff places.

As soon as the game came up, Ingram felt hot and scored 7 points with one shot, but the others didn't start well, while Kenny Dalglish started 11-7. However, after the pause, the king's attack suddenly collapsed, and continuous mistakes and shooting errors instantly exhausted the weak lead. On the defensive side, they were also unable to limit the pelican's attack. Marshall and Hayes blasted the basket wantonly in the king's restricted area, and ivandou also scored outside the three-point line. The pelican played 24-8 in the second half of the first quarter, laying a double-digit lead, The first section ends with 31-19.

In the second quarter, the king was still in a low state. Pelicans came up with another wave of 6-0, with Ingram scoring 2 + 1, the difference also came to 20 points. It seems that the adjustment of pauses does not have much effect on the king. The king's defense is still loose, and the offensive end is still disorganized. Ingram, bradso and others are not polite. They take turns to attack the opponent's internal line, and use breakthroughs to drive his teammates' three break-up feeling. Although in the second half of the second quarter, the king recovered some shooting feeling, But pelicans still maintain an efficient offensive state, the difference has not been narrowed. With Fox's three-point shot, Kenny Dalglish was 45-68 down at half-time.

In the first half of the game, Wang Yibo showed a different state of play. Pelican, on the other hand, had a power-off attack, and failed to shoot in a row, which gave the opponent a lot of opportunities for fast attack and counterattack. Fox's speed advantage was fully displayed. After a 2 + 1, the king once again hit a 10-0 climax, catching up the difference to 12 points at one stroke. At the critical moment, Ingram hit three points to help pelicans stop bleeding, then Zion and Hayes hit one after another in the interior. With Wright's make-up, the king chased the score to 74-86.

At the end of the game, both sides showed good fighting spirit. Kenny Dalglish changed his laziness in the first half and raised the defensive intensity to another level in the last quarter. On the offensive side, under the leadership of fox, they quickly played a wave of 10-6, reducing the difference to single digits. But then Zion and Ingram began to open the star mode. Zion continuously attacked the inside line and used 2 + 1 to improve their morale. Ingram even hit three points outside the three-point line. At the critical moment, fox threw his life to narrow the difference to 5 points, but then Ingram scored 4 points in a row, basically killing the game. Although there was a vicious foul episode at the last moment, Pelican still held the situation. With Fox missing three points, King lost all hope of winning the game. In the end, pelicans won 117-110 at home over Sacramento, ushering in three consecutive wins and seven consecutive defeats.
