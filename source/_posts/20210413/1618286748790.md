On April 13, the 2020-21 NBA regular season continued. The Los Angeles Lakers challenged the New York Knicks at the end of the game. They lost 96-111 to the Knicks, who won three games in a row.

On the side of the Lakers, Andre Drummond's performance was low, with only 3 points and 10 rebounds.

In Game 4 of joining the Lakers, Zhuang Shen continued to fight in New York with the team. Last time, he got 20 points and 11 rebounds in 22 minutes.

Frankly speaking, under the background that the big brow and James are still unable to come back, the Lakers need Zhuang Shen's output at both ends of the attack and defense. In addition to regular rebounding protection, the team wants him to do more.

However, in this game, Zhuang Shen quickly exposed his short board in the Knicks' high-speed tug of war. In the attack, he could not find opportunities to eat cake, defensive end, and his ability to protect the basket also failed to show. On the contrary, after the opening, team mate Kuzma blocked twice to fill the vacancy left by Zhuang Shen's depression.

Zhuang Shen's depression is not only reflected in these two aspects, even if there is no personal attack, his receiving and passing is also very hasty, less than 4 minutes has sent out two mistakes.

Fortunately, Zhuang Shen still has a little restraining effect on the inside. Frankly speaking, in the first half, the Knicks attached great importance to Zhuang Shen's defense, which lowered Zhuang Shen's data, but also created space for the outside projection of the Lakers. Throughout the first half, the Lakers were still able to shoot three-point shots from the outside, barely holding the score. Zhuang Shen only got 2 points through the second attack dunk, which was his only goal in the game.

However, when the Knicks realized that Zhuang Shen was just a paper tiger, in the second half, they paid less attention to him. They will put in Zhuang Shen's energy, transferred to the outside line, this kind of adjustment also works very quickly, along with the Laker outside line dumb fire, the visiting team quickly fell into passivity.

Dumbfounded situation, the Lakers coach Vogel also see in the eye. So, at the end of the day, the Lakers chose to change in a passive way. They replaced Zhuang Shen and activated little Gasol on the bench. After Xiao Jia came on the court, he quickly scored three points. His space involved ability also created opportunities for his teammates. Schroeder, pop and Maurice scored continuously, and the difference was reduced to 5 points.

However, this change did not persist. In the last half of the game, Vogel returned to the starting line-up and was sent back to Zhuangshen. However, after Zhuangshen came on the court, the Lakers were completely defeated.
