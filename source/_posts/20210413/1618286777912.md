On April 13, the NBA officially announced the latest strength of the team. In this issue's list, the Suns surpassed the jazz to the top, the nets continued to rank at No.3, and the Lakers returned to the top 10.

1. Suns (37-15, 2nd place last week)

Rhythm: 98.2 (24), attack efficiency: 115.5 (7), defense efficiency: 108.6 (5), net score + 7.0 (2)

Two wins over the jazz, the suns only let their opponents get 101 points every 100 rounds. However, the Suns let their opponents get 123 points every 100 rounds. The Suns won seven games in a row at home. Today, they are in five home games in a row.

2. Jazz (40-13, first place last week)

Rhythm: 99.5 (16), attack efficiency: 117.1 (3), defense efficiency: 107.6 (3), net score + 9.5 (1)

Against the lone Rangers, Suns and Trail Blazers last week, the Jazz hit only 27% of their three-point shots. In 53 games so far this season, the Jazz have only 11 three-point hits lower than their opponents. According to the schedule, in the last 16 games of the regular season, the Jazz have 15 opponents from the West.

3. Nets (36-17, third place last week)

Rhythm: 100.2 (12), attack efficiency: 117.1 (2), defense efficiency: 113.3 (25), net score + 3.9 (8)

Durant's return to the first show was a great success, with 17 points on 5-for-5. But the problem is that James Harden is still recovering, so it will take some time for the big three of the nets to combine. On the other hand, Owen was expelled in the third quarter of last week's defeat to the Lakers.

4. Nuggets (34-19, fourth place last week)

Rhythm: 97.4 (29), attack efficiency: 116.7 (4), defense efficiency: 111.7 (16), net score + 5.0 (5)

5. Clippers (37-18, 7th place last week)

Rhythm: 97.7 (27), attack efficiency: 117.7 (1), defense efficiency: 110.9 (10), net score + 6.8 (3)
