The fourth game of the playoff series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns will take place at 3:30 a.m. tomorrow at the Staples Center arena in Los Angeles. Anthony Davis (sprained left knee) and Pope (contusion of left quadriceps) are suspected of playing. However, Davis said in an interview that he would not miss the G4 game.

"I can't miss tomorrow," Davis said after training today. "As a player, I always want to be involved in this moment. I want to play in the playoffs and contribute to the success of my team. I'm a competitor and I think I'll play tomorrow. I will do everything I can to make my debut tomorrow

Davis also stressed the importance of the fourth game for the Lakers, "I think this may be the most important game in the whole series in addition to the potential seven. We want to protect the home court... In a sense, we know they will come out and play the game of despair. Obviously, the big score 3-1 and 2-2 are very different for both sides

In the third game of the series, the Lakers beat the Suns 109-95, taking a 2-1 lead. Davis accidentally injured his left leg in the second half when chasing the hat Devon Booker to the ground, but he didn't leave at that time, but insisted on playing the game. Davis had 34 points and 11 rebounds in 40 minutes. Davis said his injury did not require an MRI, but his knee had been swollen and he had been wearing compression shin guards as part of the treatment.

Asked if he would wear more personal protection in the fourth World War, Davis said with a smile: "if it helps, I don't mind going back to the 1970s."

In addition, Lakers coach Vogel also talked about Davis and pop in an interview, "Anthony (Davis) and pop will be listed as doubtful due to their respective problems. They are both dealing with some soreness, but we have hope that both of them will play Vogel said.
