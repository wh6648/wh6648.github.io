May 30 news, Nuggets 20 points defeat, the total score was pulled to 2-2. After today's G4 game, Nuggets coach Mike Malone said in an interview that the team didn't match the intensity of the playoffs.

Nikolay Jokic is the core of the Nuggets team. This game, he felt lonely. He played 27 minutes in the third quarter and made 7-for-18 shots. Among them, he made 1-for-4 three-point shot and handed over 16 points, 9 rebounds and 1 assists. The positive and negative value was - 32, the lowest in the whole game. It can be seen that Jokic did not play his own game.

As a big man in Europe, Jokic has a very comprehensive ability, he can score, coordinate, pick and roll, and also can make wedding clothes for his teammates. But in this game, joachi only sent one assists. This is one of the reasons why the Nuggets suffered a disastrous defeat in this game. When Jokic's pass can't help his teammates score, the Blazers' defense will be very targeted, which makes every shot of Jokic very difficult.

Data can tell a lot. This season's regular season, joachi field average 8.3 assists, ranked sixth in the league. But so far in the playoffs, joachi's assists per game have fallen sharply, only 3.7 times. In the first game of the series, joachi also had only one assist, and the Nuggets lost 109-123. G2 and G3, joachi each sent five assists, he helped the Nuggets win. Thus it can be seen that joachi's assists are the barometer of nuggets.

The Blazers know that as long as you limit Jorge, the Nuggets' attacking efficiency will be greatly reduced. 16 points, which is the lowest score in a single playoff game of this year. In the previous three games, he scored more than 30 points. The offensive end score is not high, the number of assists is small, and there are no teammates around Jokic. When there is such a situation, the Nuggets will be very passive, loss is inevitable.
