On May 30, the Dallas Lone Ranger and the Los Angeles Clippers will meet in the fourth game of the series tomorrow. The lone ranger official announced today that Luca dongqiqi (neck strain) was listed as a suspect. It is worth mentioning that dongqiqi complained about the sore neck and left arm after the third game of the playoffs series, which affected his shooting.

New York Times reporter mark Stein reported that Dong Qiqi said that the neck pain extended to his left arm and showed signs of discomfort later in the game. Donchic admitted that he had a "strange" feeling in his neck, which is why he was treated on the sidelines in the second half of the game.

However, more than an hour after the injury report of the lone ranger team was released, coach Carlisle expressed optimism when talking about Dong Qiqi's injury in an interview. Carlisle believed that Dong Qiqi would not miss the next game.

"If you ask me if he (Dong Qiqi) plays or not, I think he will play." Carlisle said of Dong Qiqi, "in general, in the playoffs, most of the time when the doubt will be played. But we need to see how he feels tomorrow. "

If Dong Qiqi can't play tomorrow and the lone Rangers want to keep ahead in the series, polzingis and Hadaway need to strengthen their attack and become more aggressive. Trey Burke and Jay Brunson will also play more important roles. When it comes to brenson's defensive performance struggle, coach Carlisle said: "in the face of kehuai - Leonard and Paul - George two superstars, their shooting and attack can make anyone feel struggling, this is not just brenson's personal feeling, everyone in the team will encounter difficulties to defend them."

In this round of series, Dong Qiqi averaged 39 minutes, contributing 38.0 points, 9.0 assists and 8.7 rebounds, with a shooting percentage of 51.9% and a three-point shooting percentage of 45.9%. It is worth mentioning that in the 117 minutes when Dong Qiqi was on the court, the lone Rangers scored 25 points ahead of the clippers, while in the 27 minutes when Dong Qiqi was on the bench, the lone Rangers scored 19 points more than the Clippers.
