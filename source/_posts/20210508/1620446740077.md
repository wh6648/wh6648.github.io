On May 8, it was reported that Golden State Warriors super giant Stephen curry was one of the greatest stars in the NBA, but his two-year-old son Canon didn't know that until now. Kouri's wife, Ayesha, revealed in the Ellen DeGeneres Show today that Kanon once thought his father Kouri was a professional golfer.

"In fact, for a long time, because of COVID-19, he had always considered his father occupation golf player, because he could not see Curie playing basketball at that time. So now he realized that his father and uncle played basketball. It's cool, it's exciting for all of us. " Ayesha said in the program. Ayesha revealed that Canon has started playing basketball.

Earlier this year, canon was on the court with his father curry, and he even clapped his father's high five after the Utah Jazz game in March. Ayesha also talked about Curry's many exciting records this season.

"It's crazy, it's crazy. Believe it or not, he's an old man now "It's really cool to watch him break those records and be so humble," Ayesha said. But when he comes home, it's like nothing happened. He just wants some popcorn and candy
