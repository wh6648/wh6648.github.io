On May 8, according to a report by the famous reporter of the Olympic, Samas chalaniya, a well-informed source, the warriors plan to change Juan Toscano Anderson's two-way contract into an NBA standard contract next week.

After Anderson becomes a full-time member, the warriors will free up a two-way contract, when they will sign a two-way contract with Jordan bell.

Both warriors and Anderson are interested in the NBA standard contract, sources said. As for the specific terms, the two sides are still in the process of finalizing. On the other hand, bell will be qualified to play in the playoffs for the warriors after signing a two-way contract.

Before joining the warriors, Anderson played in the warriors' Development League. As a little guy, he had a touching saving moment this season.

So far this season, Anderson has played 48 regular season games for the warriors, averaging 19.9 minutes per game, yielding 5.4 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists, with a three-point shooting rate of 40.8%.

Bell played 125 regular season games in his two seasons with warriors, averaging 12.8 minutes, 3.9 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.4 assists.
