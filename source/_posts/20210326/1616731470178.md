On March 26, the 2021 NBA trade deadline came. At 3 a.m. today, many teams completed the operation before the trade door was closed.

After the completion of all transactions, some teams profit from it, but some teams lose significantly.

Here are the winners and losers of this year's deadline:

winner:

1. Bull

Just past this trading deadline, Chicago Bulls is undoubtedly the biggest winner, they dug from the magic top inside Nikolay - wucevich. You know, at the beginning of the season, the bull's prospects are not optimistic, but with raven growing into the league's top scorer, the team can no longer be ignored. At present, the Bulls rank 10th in the East, and they are still very hopeful to compete for a playoff ticket. With the addition of the 20 + 10 level of Wushen, Chicago's lineup has become more balanced and their fighting power is better. In the East, they are no longer afraid of any opponent.

2. Nuggets

Also reaping a lot on this deadline is Denver Nuggets in the West. They won the competition in many ways and successfully brought alon Gordon to the team. In addition, through a small deal, Nuggets got the old Javier McGee. These two operations let Mr. Yue have a more reliable partner in the interior. After the Nuggets trade, they also have the ability to challenge any strong enemy in the West.

3. Clipper

In fact, since the moment when xiaoka and pickled pepper joined hands, the clippers have been hoping to get an experienced and excellent point guard to revitalize the system and stimulate the potential of pickled pepper. Unfortunately, in the days after that, the clippers were always unable to achieve their wish, and the problem of the team's backcourt without nuclear power has been bothering them. But now, with the joining of Rondo, this problem has finally been solved, and Lu Weiyuan has also been understood by the eagles. In Atlanta, his attacking talent on the bench may no longer be suppressed.

4. Heat

In fact, as early as last year's off-season, oradipo and the heat had been rumored, in order to join the heat, Audi took the initiative to refuse the Pacers' contract extension request. Later, Audi was involved in harden's deal and joined the Rockets, but his favor for the heat did not weaken at all. Two months in the Rockets, he still didn't have much enthusiasm. But now, Audi has finally gone to Miami as he wishes, and the heat also have a strong player who can attack and defend. In the competition of the eastern powers, the team has undoubtedly become more confident.

loser:

1. Magic

The deadline for the deal, magic is undoubtedly the worst team, with vucevich, funiye, alon Gordon three members were traded, the team has completely entered the reconstruction mode. In fact, in the past two years, magic has been very attentive in the management of the team. Unfortunately, this season, fultz and Isaac, the young players trained by the team, were injured one after another, which made the team completely lose the hope of the playoffs and the patience of the management. Almost overnight, magic's lineup collapsed.

2. Warrior

On the closing day of the deal, the warriors sent Brad Warner Mack and Marquis Chris away and saved $11 million in luxury tax. However, such a result is not satisfactory. After all, according to previous rumors, the warriors most want to give away are ubre and Wiggins, and what they want is the effect of a sharp cut in luxury tax. However, most of the teams in the league have already tightened their money, and they are not willing to take over the tax savings of the warriors. With the closing of the trading door, the warrior's luxury tax spending of more than 100 million is inevitable.

3. The Lakers

Although, before the deadline, the Lakers also spread a lot of internal trading rumors. But the whole evening down, the purple army has no movement, they chose to stay put, retain the existing lineup. Out of caution, the Lakers may not be to blame for doing so. However, watching the West's direct competitors, the clippers and nuggets, strengthen their weaknesses, the top management of the Lakers will have some fluctuations in their hearts. And then, in the buyout market to attack, chasing Zhuang God or Adelaide, it has become their last upgrade opportunity this season.

4. Celtic
