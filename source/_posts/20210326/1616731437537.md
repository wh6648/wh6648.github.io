Recently, harden, a migrant worker, has become a hot topic in NBA media circle.

You know, at the beginning of the season, harden broke up with the Rockets in a soap opera, and took out a "non violent and non cooperative" posture, in order to get rid of the hardship of leading the team alone in Houston. How to expect to join the nets, mustache did not enjoy a few days of leisure, and then live a "996" day. Especially after the all star weekend, when Owen started the healing mode again, when Durant was still not back, all the burden of the nets suddenly fell on harden's shoulder.

It seems that harden worked harder than he did in the Rockets.

Although, in the new owner more than two months time, harden found a new inspiration to play, and with his own gradually into a better situation, the rebound record is also climbing. Up to now, harden has played 30 games, scoring 25.4 points per game, but his average 11.5 assists and 8.7 rebounds per game have set a career high. But what is particularly striking is that during this period, mustache's average playing time per game reached 38.5 minutes, which is a new record in his personal career, and he is also far ahead of the whole league (this season).

It's no wonder that when the season comes to a later stage, more and more media people and senior experts appeal that the League should put aside its prejudices and award the MVP trophy to mustard. After all, before harden, there was no precedent in NBA history of changing teams in the middle of a season and getting the most valuable player.

The first to call out this view is Paul Pierce, the legendary star of the former Green Army. "At the moment, harden is better than anyone else in the league," he tweeted

Stephen-a-smith also highly praised harden. He said, "harden's recent performance is very shocking. He played the best point guard performance. Of course, don't forget his defense Harden is already one of the MVP candidates Harden is harden, he showed how selfless play, he is leading the nets

Barkley's praise is more outspoken, he believes that harden is the best player in the League at this stage. At that time, as the coach of harden, Steve Nash had a more real feeling. He clearly pointed out that whether harden is a different team in the current basketball net

However, harden's brilliance and the momentum of famous mouth have not reduced the doubts of the outside world. After all, in the past few years, people seem to be used to mustache's killing all sides in the regular season, but they are also disappointed by his diving performance in the playoffs. Think back to the story of Hayden's reversal of the clippers and his transformation into an invisible man in the face of the Spurs. Of course, there is also the case of Paul running away with no fighting spirit. It seems that when it comes to the playoffs, harden will always be possessed by a mysterious magic spell that is difficult to explain, and suddenly lose the desire to win.

However, some more scientific and rational experts do not agree with such a metaphysical explanation. A more rigorous view is that harden's repeated loss in the playoffs is precisely related to his overuse and overwork in the regular season.

Data don't lie. Since he entered the NBA in 2009, harden has played 871 regular season games, which is the league's attendance champion in the past 12 years. You know, harden's big brother Durant entered the League two years earlier than him, but the total number of appearances is still less than mustache's three games. In addition, in the early three years of harden's career in the thunder, he was the main player of the sixth man. If these three seasons were excluded, harden's average playing time was as high as 37.1 minutes after he became the first player. This number is second only to LeBron James in the active stars. Even in the long history of NBA, he can also rank in the top 25.

It is undeniable that harden's overweight and the addition of referee factors in his personal playing style are the reasons for his state diving in the playoffs. However, any mathematical model can not ignore the significant impact of overwork on harden and his later career in the season.

For this point, Nets coach Nash is obviously aware of it, so in the recent post game press conference, he frequently mentioned the situation of harden, and expressed his worry about mustache's tiredness. Just, Nash said so, but in the face of the pressure of the eastern rankings, he has repeatedly reneged on his word and was forced to let harden play again and again.

But just yesterday, nets away jazz, Nash chose to let harden rest for the first time, on the one hand, mustache neck injury, on the other hand, the coaching staff really can't bear to let him go on like this. Of course, the ranking of the nets and the thickness of the Nets' lineup also gave them the strength to take turns with harden.

In harden's opinion, the so-called load management has never been his concern. In the face of the media, bearded is very calm. He said, "this is me. If my career is coming to an end tomorrow, I can't play basketball any more. I know that I've given everything and I don't take any shortcut, then I can accept the fact. This is my mentality."
