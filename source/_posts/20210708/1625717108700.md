On July 8, the Suns officially announced that the team's forward Dario Saric suffered a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee, and his return date is yet to be determined.

In the second half of the first quarter of G1 in the finals on Wednesday, Saric broke bucks center Brooke Lopez with the ball and hurt his knee when he landed. Then he limped back to the dressing room and did not return to the rest of G1.

Saric is one of the Suns' rotation players, so his serious injury is not good news for the team. After G1 Saric was injured, Tori Craig and frank Kaminsky filled Saric's playing time. In the end, the Suns beat the Bucks 118-105 at home, leading 1-0.

"It really breaks your heart," suns coach Monty Williams said today. "I've coached Saric twice, first in Philadelphia and now in the suns. He's a hard-working man, incredible guy, he's so looking forward to appearing on the stage of the finals... It's very sad to hear that this morning

As a forward who has been in the League for five years, Saric averaged 11.1 minutes in the playoffs this year, with 4.8 points and 2.6 rebounds.

Craig is part of the Suns' regular rotation, and Kaminsky didn't get too many chances in the playoffs this year. So this time Saric is injured, it's an opportunity for Kaminski.
