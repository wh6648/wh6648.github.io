On July 7, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that if Kevin love and the Cavaliers reach a buyout, the warriors will pursue the God of love as much as possible.

Today, the U.S. men's basketball team opened its training camp in Las Vegas, and Lok Fu has been selected into the 12 man squad for the Tokyo Olympics. Talking about why I went to Tokyo, Lok Fook said: "I think participating in the Olympic Games can help me get back on track."

Lok Fu's current contract will expire in the summer of 2023. His salary for the 21-22 season was $31 million, and his salary for the 22-23 season was $28.9 million¡¶ Cleveland honest man previously revealed that love's role in the Cavaliers in the 21-22 season is expected to become smaller.

NBA reporter Sam Amick revealed earlier this week that he heard that the Cavaliers will try to send off Lok Fu this summer. It is reported that Lok Fu has many potential suitors, including pelicans, 76ers, heat, clippers and pioneers.

"Lok Fu has been on the warriors' shortlist in recent years, and the pursuit of Lok Fu is likely to become more intense in the coming months," the San Francisco Chronicle said. More and more people in the League think that love will make a buy-out with Cleveland, and then love will join a championship team with a base salary. If Lok Fu is eventually bought out, the warriors may try their best to sign him

It is pointed out that Lefu lived with Kevin Durant during the training camp of American men's basketball team, so KD is not ruled out to recruit Lefu. In addition, LeBron James's Laker team will also become one of the potential consideration objects of Lok Fu.
