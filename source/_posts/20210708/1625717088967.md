On July 7, Kelly ubre hinted in an interview with Yahoo sports reporter Chris Hannes that he might not return to the warriors next season.

Last November, when the warriors and the thunder completed a deal to get ubre from Oklahoma City. Ubre's current contract expires at the end of the season, which means he becomes a full free agent this summer.

Earlier in an interview, warriors coach Steve Cole said he hoped that ubre could return as a substitute next season. After all, clay Thompson will return in the 21-22 season. What does ubre think of this?

"I'm a little angry with that, it's like adding fuel to the fire," said ubre. "I'm 25 years old, my data are getting better every year, and my role and opportunities in the team are improving. But this season, it's getting less. As the season went on, I didn't get a fair chance to show my ability. Yes, it's a bit unfair. "

Talking about the free market this summer, ubre said: "I am still a member of the warriors. And when the free market opens, my team and I weigh all the options. But anyway, I'm still a member of the warriors. That's all I know so far

Ubre told Hannes that he would like to get a long-term contract¡° The warriors management knows all this, and I'm not good enough to be put in a box, "said ubre.

The warriors have the Early Bird rights of ubre, which means they can renew their contract on the salary cap. According to the source, ubre and his team will seek a $20 million annual salary contract in the free market. But the warriors face a super luxury tax. If the warriors offer a $10 million contract, they will pay $70 million in luxury tax.
