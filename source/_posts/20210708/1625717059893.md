Boston Celtic star Jason Tatum is currently training in Las Vegas to prepare for the next Tokyo Olympics. Today, after training, Tatum spoke in an interview about how he felt about taking over Kobe Bryant's No. 10 Jersey.

"It's an absolute honor for me and I'll wear it with pride. This (Tokyo Olympics) is the first Olympic Games since we lost Kobe, and its (No. 10 Jersey) is even more significant at this moment. I will certainly attach great importance to it. " Tatum said¡° I hope and hope to get this number. Everyone knows that he is my favorite player. I put on my favorite player's number when I was 15, I just feel that I have a connection with him

Kobe, wearing No. 10, led the U.S. men's basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012. Tatum has worn the number several times since then for the U.S. team and will wear it at the Tokyo Olympics. No. 10 Jersey is of great significance in all sports. For the American men's basketball team, it's Kobe's. When Kobe decided not to take part in the 2016 Olympics, the number fell to Carey Owen, another player who adored Kobe like Tatum. And now, just like two years ago when the U.S. team played in the basketball world cup, this shirt is Tatum's.

"I'm really happy for Tatum to have this moment. I knew Tatum when I was 12, he deserved what he got, he will continue to have more because he is such a great player. I'm happy for him. That's his idol. He can represent that number. I know that when he puts on No. 10, he will have that "Mamba spirit." BAM Adebayor said.

"He's become more like a two-way player, he's more confident, he's developed more skills, he's also more offensive," U.S. men's basketball coach Popovich said of Tatum
