On July 8, Phoenix Suns star Chris Paul was interviewed by the media after training today. During the interview, he talked about how to maintain high-efficiency sports ability at the age of 36.

Paul is one of the few players in the league who not only have basketball intelligence but also have athletic talent. When asked how to maintain such high athletic ability at the age of 36, Paul said: "I know that I focus on training every day, whether it's cold or hot, so when I step on the court, I don't think I'm 36 years old. I'm very grateful to the team around me, whether it's chefs, fitness coaches, trainers or other staff, who help me make sure that my body is always ready for the game, knowing that it takes a lot of time. If you're a competitor, it's nothing. It's just part of everyday life. I remember Kobe saying years ago, he said you have to love the sport deeply and repeat the same training. Some people may only be hot for three minutes, but that's not me because I like the game and I want to play at a high level

Paul has shown leadership in many ways, and of course, this season has faced more challenges, including the inability to work as a team. So, the time spent off the field with teammates, especially young players like Ayrton, maybe even Devon Booker. So does Paul think he has gained trust and reached the highest level in history? In response, Paul said: "it's a great question. I've spent a season here and I've only been to two places - the training ground and the stadium. We didn't go bowling, we didn't do what we usually do as a team. So you have to accumulate in practice, build trust on the road, in the game, in the car. I think that's the great work our team does to make sure we come here every day, train and work, but at the same time make sure we have fun and really enjoy each other. "

Compared with the thunder, the Rockets, the clippers and the Hornets (the predecessor of the Pelican), what is Paul better prepared to play in the finals now? "I don't know, our team is a little different," says Paul. We're a real team, a team you can't rely on just one or two people. Everyone in our team has the ability to play a big game. Everyone is very comfortable and accepts their role. Yes, I think I'm ready physically and mentally. Early in my career, I might not be able to get that. I appreciate it, and as I said, we're in a very good position

Is Paul saying that the Suns are a better team, or is the structure of this team better than other teams because they are in the finals¡° No, I don't say that, because I played in New Orleans in 2007-08 season, which is one of the most special teams I have ever played, and my first year in Houston, which is also a very good team. In my last season in New Orleans, I played in the playoffs with Monty Williams, which is a special team. You can't always win in some of the best teams you're in Said Paul.
