On July 8, NBA draft expert Jonathan kiwani reported that he believes that Cade Cunningham is most likely to become the number one pick of the year.

In the previous Lotto draw, the pistons won the number one draw. "I've been told that corningham is very excited about joining the pistons," kivoni said

Corningham, 2.03 meters tall, is a full back from Oklahoma State. According to the tip from the famous ESPN reporter Adrian wernalovski, as the most popular champion, corningham plans to train only for the pistons.

Sources said the Rockets, Cavaliers, thunder and pelicans and other teams are evaluating the possibility of winning the top spot in the upward trade. Kivoni revealed that these assessments are still at an early stage, even if there may be a deal, it will not happen before the draft conference.

According to the results of the lottery, the Rockets hold the top spot, the Cavaliers are the first round team, the thunder team No. 6, and the pelicans team No. 10.

Corningham is seen as a "weakened version" of Luca donchich, who has brought Oklahoma into crazy March this year.
