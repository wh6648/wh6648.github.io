[comprehensive evaluation]

advantage:

Jared Butler is a smart, aggressive and difficult double guard. He is a gifted scorer. He can create his own scoring opportunities, and he can also shoot after catching the ball empty handed. He has a strong will to pass and excellent vision of passing. This season, even if he is not the team's master, he can still send 4.8 assists per game. He has a strong ability to end the attack with both hands and can also act as a team metronome. In possession of the current popular offensive skills (such as three-point, breakthrough) at the same time, he also has a silky handle.

Butler basketball intelligence is very high, can calmly carry out a variety of tactics, he is very comfortable in the pick and roll attack, but also grasp the dislocation opportunity, he can rely on the foot, rely on a high shot posture to singles big man, can also eat small man in the low position. In defense, his ability is also solid. He has excellent position selection, outstanding ability to steal, timely defense change and strong communication ability in defense. He knows how to limit the opponent's breakthrough, and often forces the opponent to shoot hard. In addition, there is still room for improvement in his various techniques. The three-point shooting rate of his junior year has reached 41.6%, which is really impressive.

Disadvantages:

Butler's biggest problem is that his athletic talent is relatively mediocre, which has become an important reason for his average 3.3 mistakes in his college career. Also due to the lack of sports ability, he has less chance to get rid of the opponent with absolute speed, and more needs to rely on the ball control technology and some creative thinking on the court to create opportunities. Although rebounding is not Butler's main item, but in this respect, his ability and willingness are lacking.

Butler's position is relatively vague. During the period of Baylor University, he and Davian Mitchell are stable backcourt partners. Because Mitchell is in charge, Butler can freely take the role of shooting guard. But the 1.91M, 88kg body, after entering the NBA, playing the second position is bound to suffer. At that time, Butler may face great pressure of transformation, which may affect the development of his career.

[career overview and prospect]

Jared Butler was born on August 25, 2000. He grew up in Richardson, Louisiana, and gradually showed his basketball talent as a teenager. As early as 11 years old, butler went to other states to play basketball championships of the same age.

Later, Butler entered riverside college and became a member of the school basketball team in the eighth grade. Over the next few years, Butler concentrated on polishing his skills.

He was once again selected as the best player in the state and was also rated as the best player in the picayoune times (one of the most influential media in Louisiana).

After graduating from high school, Butler received the evaluation of 4-star high school students from several websites, and was invited by three universities, namely the University of Alabama, the University of Virginia and Baylor University. At first, Butler chose the University of Alabama and rejected Baylor University because the latter didn't work hard enough to recruit himself, and Baylor University's guard list was too long to have enough scholarships.

However, shortly after joining the University of Alabama, Butler regretted that he refused to participate in summer training with the team and made it clear that he would transfer to Baylor University. It happened that in August 2018, Baylor University vacated a scholarship due to the retirement of some players, so Butler was able to be replaced.

Unfortunately, in 2020, COVID-19 led to the crazy shutdown in March, and let Butler miss a chance to show himself on a higher stage. Later, after several choices, he did not participate in last year's draft conference.

But it turns out that Butler's choice is extremely wise. In his junior year, Butler has finally become a famous university player in the United States. This season, Butler played 30 games, and all started, he played 30.3 minutes, got 16.7 points, 4.8 assists, 3.3 rebounds, 2 steals, shooting 47.1%, three-point shooting 41.6%, six figures have created a career high. He led Baylor University to achieve quite brilliant results. They sang all the way to the crazy three, and they were invincible in the national championship. In the final, Baylor University limited the opponent with iron and steel defense, while Butler got 22 points and 7 assists, which was the number one meritorious player to win.

He was selected as the best team in the comprehensive evaluation of the United States for a while, and also entered the list of the best team in the 12th division (first team) and the best defensive first team. Originally, in this year's draft forecast list, he was only in the second round. However, after the end of the crazy three, Butler's ranking quickly rushed into the first round. Compared with the draft situation of mop in the past few years, it can be said that Butler's prospect in this year's draft conference is still worth looking forward to.
